This investigation will move forward in a bipartisan way. We need to follow the facts wherever they lead.

There are no excuses for what we’ve seen in the last 24 hours. Lying is not a rookie mistake.
"We now know the denials of contacts with Russians that we've heard during the campaign, transition &amp; administration are all patently false."
This is black and white: Trump officials at the highest levels knew Russia was working to aid Donald Trump &amp; welcomed Russia's interference.
That’s why we have to continue this investigation. There’s a lot more work to do.

"If companies can’t reform on their own, consumers (and voters) may demand these kinds of changes on their own terms #AspenIdeas"

"With the rise of the part-time, #Freelance, &amp; #GigEconomy workforce, fewer workers are spending their careers at one firm. #AspenIdeas"
Tax credits &amp; capital gains reforms could incentivize reinvestment and reduce outsourcing &amp; short-termism. #AspenIdeas
