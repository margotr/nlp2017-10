Graham-Cassidy is really #TrumpCare 2.0. Every version gets worse.
#TrumpCare: “It’s like a bad zombie movie that just won’t end.” @TheNewMexican https://t.co/qam5iRAcqa
"Senate Republicans are flying blind. This is basic governance, we need all the facts on #TrumpCare before we vote. https://t.co/UYb9AbAiuG"
"I support #ChildCare4All! Working families in NM deserve to know their children have quality child care, without breaking the bank"
#ChildCare4All is part of #2gen approach to help families succeed by supporting children &amp; parents together so we can grow our economy.
In #NM too many families don’t have access to quality early learning &amp; care that will help their children thrive that they can afford.
#FY18NDAA will bring major benefits to our economy and strengthen New Mexico's position as a leader in national security for years to come.

Unbelievable that Senate Rs want to revive #TrumpCare &amp; force a vote before we know how many will lose coverage &amp; how much people will pay.
#CassidyGraham would do irreversible harm to NM because it puts #Medicaid on the chopping block by repealing expansion &amp; block granting it.
