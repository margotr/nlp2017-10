The latest version of Trumpcare is the meanest one yet. Let me explain why. https://t.co/VGkl8uUD8r
6/ #GrahamCassidy FORCES states to drop preexisting condition protection. Not a matter of opinion.  Incontrovertible fact.
5/ Every insurance expert knows this.  Which is why virtually every previous version of Trumpcare included some form on mandate.
"4/ Risk pools would get sicker and sicker - insurers will flee. Thus, states will HAVE to allow insurers to price based on medical history."
"3/ Without mandate, consumers in states w preexisting condition protection would logically wait to buy insurance until they get sick."
"2/ Bill gives ""option"" to states to charge sick people more. But states will HAVE to take the option bc bill has no individual mandate."
"1/ There is no ""he said/she said"" on whether new version of Trumpcare ends protections for people with preexisting conditions.  It does."

"6/ Even if states wanted to keep preexisting condition protections, they can't bc #GrahamCassidy gets rid of individual mandate."
5/ Massive funding cuts to states. $4 billion to my little state of CT by 10 year mark. States will either slash programs or raise taxes.
4/ Premiums go up for everyone. 20% in first year alone. Gets way worse after that if you are 50+ or making under 400% of poverty.
"3/ Medicaid expansion vanishes. Millions will lose insurance, including loads of disabled and children. Many will die without care."
"2/ Lifetime caps, annual caps, charging older people more - the greatest hits of Trumpcare - all back again in #GrahamCassidy"

Trump knew NKorea would be a problem. Yet he intentionally keeps vacant EVERY diplomatic position that is relevant to solving this crisis.
I'm worried about Trump's bellicosity on NKorea. I'm more worried that he has ZERO senior people who know how to solve crises like this.

I want to thank everyone who shared their stories with me. I am going to fight this disaster of a bill with everything that I’ve got.
This is a fraction of the stories I’ve received from people across the state of Connecticut. This bill is bad news for the families I serve
“We don't know how we will pay for a policy increase of over 5X what younger people pay. It will be unaffordable for us.”
"“Under Trumpcare with an age tax and a new law that allows insurance companies to punish older Americans, her insurance will soar.”"
Peg from Greenwich - “My wife is 60 yrs old and she is self employed. Right now she can afford insurance with ConnectiCare.”
“MS isn't a disease I could have prevented. Cuts to Medicaid will make it harder for me to afford the care I need.”
"“Without my treatment, I have a good chance of having the disease progress quickly. Luckily, now my treatments are covered."""
“Medicaid covers what my Medicare doesn't. I don't know how I would have ever been able to get my treatment and MRIs paid for without it.”
"Katherine from Simsbury - “I have multiple sclerosis and my MS treatment alone is now almost $20,000 a month.”"
"“I didn’t ask for cancer. Not a day goes by that I wish I didn’t have to fight this. Now, I have to fight for the right to health care.”"
Angela from New Canaan - “I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in 2015 at the age of 49.”
“Dominique didn’t do anything wrong. She was born this way and deserves to have a fulfilling life.”
“Who are we as a people and a country if we cannot take care of those who for no fault of their own cannot take care of themselves?”
"“Her care costs $40,000 each year. Thanks to Medicaid’s Community First Choice program, we’ve finally been able to get financial help.”"
"“She also loves school, enjoys music and singing and Disney movies. She plays buddy baseball &amp; rides horses at a therapeutic riding stable.”"
"Mark from Westbrook - “My daughter, Dominique has an cerebral palsy. She suffers from seizures and has a number of other health challenges”"
"“Rylan is 2 years old now. If Republicans pass their health care bill, his coverage could be in danger.”"
"“He would have exhausted his lifetime cap before he was even a month old. Thanks to the ACA, lifetime caps were eliminated.”"
"“After a 3-week stay in the pediatric ICU, open-heart surgery, and hours on bypass, his medical costs were nearly a million dollars.”"
"“I was worried his surgery wouldn’t be covered, but thanks to the ACA I didn’t have to worry about him being denied.”"
“Rylan was born with a congenital heart defect &amp; had to be rushed to CT Children’s for emergency open heart surgery to keep him alive.”
"Isabelle from Unionville - “Before I had my second son, Rylan, I never thought about how my insurance plan worked. I didn’t need to.”"
“I’m afraid I won’t be able to access life-sustaining care for myself and my son. I don’t want him to suffer like I did before the ACA.”
"“If protections for pre-existing conditions &amp; restricting lifetime caps are not preserved, I fear I will face certain medical bankruptcy.”"
"“Before the ACA, the disease made it nearly impossible for me to obtain health coverage, let alone affordable coverage.”"
Pamela from Ellington - “I have a potentially life-threatening genetic condition called Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) and so does my son.”
"“The Affordable Care Act saved my life. Without it, I’d probably be dead, within months.”"
"“I have friends who are on Medicaid who are petrified that if they lose their ability to get it, they won’t have health care.”"
"“Health care is the number one priority in my life, it’s more important than income, more important than anything else.”"
"“Even in a good health year, I probably have one or two hospitalizations that require IV antibiotics. I’m on a whole suite of medications”"
"Jon from Meriden - “I was born with cystic fibrosis, a disease that causes my lungs to fill with fluid.”"
To repeal without replacement and guaranteed patient protections is to deny our most vulnerable and most promising the chance of survival
"Without the protection of the ACA, she must live not only w the fear of recurrence, but fear of recurrence w no access to affordable care."
"“But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, she was able to get the treatment she needs. She has been in remission for 5 years.”"
“The cost of her care was huge. Paying for that care personally would have bankrupted my husband and me.”
"“The treatment to cure Leslie’s cancer was harsh and painful. I watched my daughter struggle daily with bone pain, nausea, chills…”"
Bonnie from West Hartford - “My daughter Leslie was diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma when she was just 22 years old.”
“Slashing Medicaid would be devastating to my family. I'm a working parent and I only want to be able to care for my children.”
"""Knowing my son can get the meds he needs to keep him healthy, alive and able to move is a blessing. It's something I do not want to lose."""
“Going part time caused me to lose my health coverage and the three of us are now covered by HUSKY A.”
“I've worked full-time since college. I'm now 40 and had to make the difficult choice to work part time to accommodate his doctor visits.”
"“He is now 20 months old, and I have had to make some tough decisions in the past year to care for my son properly.”"
Kamera from Stamford - “I am a single mom to 2 children. My youngest has a rare genetic disease called Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome.”
“These services are thanks to Medicaid. I'm afraid this bill will hurt his continued special education services which he needs very much.”
"“He will be 8 and thanks to speech pathologists, occupational therapists and special education he has come a long way.”"
Erin from Mashantucket - “My son has autism and has been receiving services through the public school system.”
“Surgeries I underwent potentially saved my life &amp; didn't bankrupt our family. No one should choose btwn life-saving surgery &amp; bankruptcy.”
"“If the Republican bill passes, my preexisting condition - since birth! - could no longer be covered.”"
"Kristen from New Haven - “I am BRCA positive, and though I have taken preventive action, the risk is still there.”"
“But no one should have to go through that in order to fight sickness with their loved ones.”
“Im fortunate to have had so many yrs to fight alongside my mom. I would've declared bankruptcy if it meant keeping her alive &amp; comfortable”
"“The GOP bill would bankrupt families caring for their loved ones. It would make life so much harder for people with ALS."""
“ALS is expensive. It's a death sentence. But for now people can live a more comfortable life &amp; wait for a cure because they have insurance”
“There are hundreds of thousands of people living with ALS. This bill would force people to chose btwn their loved one or their livelihood.”
Melinda from Middletown - “My mom passed away almost 5 years ago from ALS. She fought for 10 years because of Medicare.”
“I rely on the ACA &amp; I can’t afford the increases I would pay under the GOP plan. Anyone can get older or sicker.” It shouldn’t be this way.
“I went back to the workforce &amp; found out my age made me less competitive in the job market. I ended up with a job but no benefits.”
"Julia from Westport - “I’m over age 55. When the recession hit, I got laid off like a lot of Americans”"

“I know so many independent businesses that would not be able to survive without the Affordable Care Act.”

Paula from Glastonbury - “I had insurance through my husband’s company.” He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died 8 weeks later.
“Now she has excellent coverage and no longer worries about losing everything should she get sick and end up hospitalized.”
"“Until the Affordable Care Act, she was never able to get a quality health insurance plan because of her pre-existing condition.”"
"“She is 29 now, the picture of health and has been completely cleared medically by her cardiologists.”"
Jim from Stonington - “My daughter was born with a heart valve problem that required surgery when she was only 2 days old.”
"“I have always worked hard, at my job and as a caregiver. I did it all with little to no help. ACA was there to help me when I needed it.”"
"“Now I am covered and getting treatment for the severe arthritis I developed over my years as a nurse, and for diabetes as well.”"
“I no longer have to worry about losing insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. I'm not sure I'd have made it without the ACA.”
“I also went through a 10 year period of being the only one able to take care of my older relatives. I cared for both my aunt and my mom.”
"“After a job change, layoff, or after divorce, for example. I never could afford COBRA on top of a mortgage and raising kids.”"
“I've spent my life seeing to the care and comfort of others. Yet there are times in my life when I've had to go without health care.”
"Gretchen from Winstead - “I worked as an LPN for many yrs here in CT. You may think nurses don't have to worry about healthcare, but we do.”"
RT @mojorao233: @ChrisMurphyCT My 92 yr old mother is in a nursing home. She rarely even knows who I am. Medicare does not cover long term…
“Continuous care is important. Lapses in policy for people like me is the difference between life or death. Period.”
"“If Medicaid gets stripped, I could die. Medicaid ensures my testing, medication, and helps me monitor this very difficult disease."""
"“My full recovery took 18 months. I try to live a normal life now. But at any time, I can get very ill again.”"
"“I paid taxes my whole life, worked hard. It was my turn to get some relief and I got it. I deserved to live.”"
"“I was on Medicaid during the hospital stay, physical therapy, then home recovery. The costs were in the millions.”"
“The ACA saved my life. It helped me get all the CT scans necessary to diagnose my illness as Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia”
"Paul from Litchfield - “I have a rare interstitial lung disease. I was in the hospital for 48 days, very ill and in critical condition.”"
“The story of the ACA is just as much about economic liberation and entrepreneurship as it is about health care.”
“Words cannot express the relief I felt when the dread of being denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition evaporated.”
"“Thankfully by the time I finished school in 2010, the ACA had passed and I was able to pursue a career path of my choosing”"
“I contemplated my post-college job prospects not based on earning potential or interest but based on the insurance that was offered.”
Mike from Milford - “I was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 at 21 yrs old.”
RT @Emeraldashct: @ChrisMurphyCT Without ACA neither myself of my children would have insurance due to our pre-existing conditions.
“I'm concerned my Husky benefits could be affected. I'm finally getting my life &amp; health back. I don't want to go back to how I was living.”
"“If it weren't for the coverage I received through the exchange last year, I don't know what would have happened to me.”"
"“When I had my first visit to the doctor, my blood pressure was very high. I probably would have ended up having a stroke without treatment”"
"Thanks to tax credits “I was able to get insurance, get back on my high blood pressure medicine &amp; start treatment for my panic attacks.”"
Toni from Norwalk - “I have Husky D through the exchange. I was able to get a tax subsidy to purchase a plan that likely saved my life.”
"“I want our daughter to grow up in a world where she has access to the best health care possible, care that made her 1st birthday possible."""
"“I couldn't imagine there being a lifetime cap, or needing approval to perform an expensive life-saving procedure.”"
“Our daughter’s hospital bills have already reached $1 million and she is only one year old. Her life is worth every penny.”
“We are now very nervous about what the new health care policy could mean to our family.”

"In December 2013, Betsy had stage 4 cancer and her insurance company dropped her. Her doctor told her she needed surgery."
"Betsy from Litchfield - “Without the Affordable Care Act, I would not have health insurance at all due to my pre-existing condition.”"
I’ll be tweeting stories all day from families in Connecticut who shared what it means to have health care &amp; what it would mean to lose it.
Senate Republicans need to hear the real life stories about what this bill would do to families. So that's what I'm going to do today.
"But clearly, these numbers aren’t enough to move many of my Republican colleagues who are still supporting this dumpster fire of a bill."
It’s no secret that the numbers behind the Republican health care bill are bad. 22 million will lose insurance &amp; premiums will go up.
Recently @RepEsty &amp; I intro'd our bill to create a National Green Bank which will create jobs &amp; help the environment https://t.co/eufL8xVwpU
