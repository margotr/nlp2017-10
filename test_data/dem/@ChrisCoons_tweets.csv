The ban is discriminatory &amp; would make our nation less safe.
Courts are consistently coming to the same conclusion that the travel ban is unlawful.
The travel ban is in direct violation of the principles embedded in our Constitution.
I'm encouraged that yet another attempt by @POTUS to implement a travel ban has been rejected. https://t.co/OrhP97c7aG
If Republicans want to dismantle Obamacare – they ought to tell us what their plan is – but they’re keeping the public in the dark
Health care is too important for secrecy – we’re talking about the lives and health care of millions of Americans here!
"I wasn’t in the Senate in 2009, but I remember well the 100+ hearings, meetings, roundtables, &amp; amendments to the #ACA"
Let’s be clear: the GOP ‘health care plan’ would mean 14 million+ Americans lose Medicaid coverage
"The news may be focused elsewhere, but the biggest story in the Senate is the closed-door, secretive process to dismantle our h/care system"
Senate Ds &amp; Rs should work TOGETHER on moving forward to get a better health care system for all Americans.
There have been no public hearings or debates about the GOP health care bill. That’s ridiculous https://t.co/rnmAXRZCyc
To my Senate GOP colleagues: we have to do better than this. The American people deserve to know what’s in this bill https://t.co/63CitGYrLH

I will fight to make sure Congress continues to fully fund CDBG &amp; HOME and other important HUD programs.
Proposed cuts to vital pgms like CDBG &amp; HOME would be devastating. I know how impt these pgms are for vulnerable populations across the U.S.

"That said, as a member of the Judiciary Cmte, I’m going to begin thoroughly reviewing Wray’s record right away."

#Opioid abuse prevention must remain a priority in Congress.
#Paris withdrawal is a step back from global engagement. Every other G7 country is committed &amp; engaged in the fight against #ClimateChange.
We must continue to support emissions reductions &amp; clean energy research. It is necessary for Americans to remain competitive &amp; safe.
It is time to get serious about #ClimateChange. We cannot retreat from this threat to humankind.
Delawareans are concerned about the impacts of #ClimateChange. They are looking for leadership in our response to its evolving challenges.
The #Paris agreement was the result of 25 yrs of hard work over 4 previous presidential admins. A withdrawal is a mistake.
Our failure to lead on #ClimateChange rejects scientific consensus &amp; harms our credibility
"Withdrawing from #Paris puts US govt at odds with US businesses, our closest allies, &amp; millions of Americans"
