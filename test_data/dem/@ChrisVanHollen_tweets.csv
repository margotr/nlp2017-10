"McConnell &amp; Ryan would then present this WealthCare bill to Congress for final votes in September, with limited debate and NO amendments."
And even if we do go to a House-Senate conference—like McConnell wants—they would once again be protecting the wealthy behind closed doors.
"In fact, McCarthy is telling members to stick around so they can act before August!"
But don’t be fooled—House Republicans could pass this bad bill right away and it could go directly to the President’s desk.
"In Maryland alone, the #SkinnyRepeal would leave 200,000+ uninsured w/an annual premium increase of $700+."
