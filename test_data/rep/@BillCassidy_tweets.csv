You wouldn't agree to buy a car without knowing the price. Why would you with your health care? we need price transparency #wphealthcare
"CT scans can cost $250-$2500 depending on where you go, but you have no way of knowing. Our plan creates price transparency #wphealthcare"
Confident that @RepTomPrice will do a great job as HHS secretary to institute health care reform that works for patients. #wphealthcare
Congress should give Americans hope for a better vision of healthcare that will work for them. #wphealthcare
Obamacare has left 30 million uninsured. Republican alternative will insure more w/ better care. #wphealthcare
A fraction of Obamacare Medicaid funds actually reaches the patients. What a waste. #wphealthcare
"Why should states, with massive premium increases be forced to keep #Obamacare , a system that is failing them? #wphealthcare"
"Republicans have said, ""if you like your plan, you can keep it."" We mean it #wphealthcare"
Worked for 30 years in a hospital for the uninsured. These are my patients. Need a plan that gives them the power of choice. #wphealtchare
Obamacare forces Americans to pay more for benefits that they don't need. That needs to change. @wphealthcare

Good conversation and debate this morning. Lots of good thoughts and ideas shared about how to reform Medicaid. https://t.co/GJPt7h6pbC
"Medicaid helps poorer individuals but right now money is not used efficiently-too much going to institutions, not to help patients #HCReform"
#Medicaid has poor outcomes. Patients need provider accountability. #ProHC reform
We have to go past the anecdote and look at the data: patients only receive 20-40 cents of value for every $1 spent by the government #ProHC
Medicaid is the illusion of coverage without the power of access.
".@rebakahgeeMD agrees, Medicaid spends too much on institutions and not enough on patients"
Expanding Medicaid and not seeing improvement in the service shows a problem with the program. Spending more money with no result #ProHC
