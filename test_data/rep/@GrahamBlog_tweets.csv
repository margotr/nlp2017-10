President Obama’s deal with Iran is hemorrhaging support from the American people.
President Obama's speech today is just another example of his reliance on endless strawmen to divert attention from his failed policies.
Pres Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 the world’s most radical Islamist regime with the means to acquire a new military arsenal.
President Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists &amp; the world’s most radical Islamist regime with money to pay for the bomb.
Pres Obama’s deal Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists &amp; the world’s most radical Islamist regime with missiles to deliver a bomb.
Pres Obama’s Iran deal empowers 1 of our chief antagonists and the world’s most radical Islamist regime with a pathway to the bomb.
Pres Obama is trying hard to sell a bad deal with Iran &amp; American people aren’t buying it. Straw man arguments are not going to help.

Would I like to live in a world where there were no #ExIm Banks? Sure. But I refuse to close our ExIm Bank and China keeps theirs open.
"If our #ExIm Bank and its competitive financing go away permanently, the United States will lose market share and it will cost us jobs."
I refuse to live in a world where we close our #ExIm Bank and China keeps theirs open. I am not doing that. That is unilateral surrender.

#8. Certification by the president Iran changed its aggressive behavior &amp; no longer qualifies as a designated state sponsor of terrorism.
#7. Removal of all enriched uranium from Iran. No need for Iran to possess a large stockpile of low enriched or any highly enriched uranium.
#6. Iran must NOT be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges.
#5. There must be an explicit process for the 'snapback' re-imposition of sanctions if Iran violates the deal.
#4. Sanctions relief/access to funds be phased in &amp; fully conditioned on IAEA certification Iran in full &amp; sustained compliance.
"#3.  Anytime, anywhere inspections of all Iranian military and nonmilitary facilities."
#2. Closure of all hardened and formerly secret sites. Iran must come clean on all outstanding issues raised by the IAEA.
#1. Iran must not be allowed an enrichment capability greater than the practical needs to supply one commercial reactor.
"My 8 Principles to ensure we get the right answers and achieve a sound, enforceable deal regarding Iran's nuclear program."

This latest episode once again shows that under President Obama’s leadership it is better to be America’s enemy than her friend. #Ukraine
It is time for President Obama to quit equivocating and quickly provide #Ukraine the defensive weapons it needs.
The Ukrainian people do not have time for President Obama’s “strategic patience.”
President Obama’s continual weakness in the face of aggression is making the world a more dangerous place.
The Obama Doctrine of leading from behind and showing weakness in face of aggression seems to be spreading throughout the world.
"There was no mention of defensive weapons, but I hope that will be the Obama Administration's next step. #Ukraine #MSC2015"
.@VP Biden's challenge to all nations to stand up to Russia and stand behind #Ukraine will matter -- if heeded. #MSC2015
@VP Biden gave an excellent and compelling speech exposing Russia for the bad actors they have become. #MSC2015
The translated version of Obama's “Strategic Patience” -- I can’t wait to pass this mess I made onto someone else. (RT if you agree.)
"The Obama Doctrine, or “Strategic Patience,” has led to a world in chaos."
The consequences of Obama’s “Strategic Patience” are an America that is less secure and at greater risk.
"I doubt ISIL, the Iranian mullahs, or Vladmir Putin will be intimidated by President Obama’s strategy of ‘Strategic Patience.’"

It really in many ways started with Benghazi when our consulate was overrun and our first Ambassador was killed...  http://t.co/a19g5OxmS1
"I think Putin believes Obama is really all talk and no action. And unless we push back soon, the worse is yet to come."
"Putin basically came to the conclusion after Benghazi, Syria, Egypt - everything Obama has been engaged in - he's a weak indecisive leader."
"It started with Benghazi. When you kill Americans and nobody pays a price, you invite this type of aggression. #Ukraine"
"The world is NEVER in a better place when you have a weak, indecisive American president. And Russia is a symptom of that weakness."

I strongly urge the Obama Administration to rally the world community to Ukraine’s side before it’s too late.
President has said on  occasion as more information is made available he would share it with the public. Statement has not borne fruit.
These are sometimes disjointed and do not always allow for a full and thorough investigation. #Benghazi
"We've had various House &amp; Senate comm, along with State Depts ARB, investigating the small pieces of Benghazi within their jurisdictions."
A joint select committee is the best means to ensure Benghazi is fully investigated and all questions are answered once and for all.
"Hwevr before calling Morell, strongly encourage House &amp; Senate ldershp to establish a joint select committee to investigate #Benghazi."
