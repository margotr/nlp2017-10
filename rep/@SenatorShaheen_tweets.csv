@PPFA How will your bill increase access to primary and preventive health care services in rural areas?
How will your bill affect women’s health? Do you eliminate funding for @PPFA? Are women’s preventive health services preserved?
How will your bill ensure that people with substance use disorder can get the treatment they need?
Will your legislation eliminate #Medicaid expansion for the millions who rely on it for healthcare and substance misuse treatment?
Will your legislation continue to provide protections for people with pre-existing conditions?

This is a nationwide crisis. It’s time to mobilize a nationwide response that is equal to the challenge.
We cannot accept that nine out of 10 Americans with substance use disorders do not get treatment.
"We cannot avert our eyes from 47,000 Americans killed by lethal overdoses each year."
Recently @NatlGovsAssoc endorsed emergency appropriations to address the opioid crisis. https://t.co/lU6ZsMVTAS
"When people don’t get treatment, they are overdosing in overwhelming numbers. https://t.co/5RZ3DdvpRB"
I’ve seen firsthand in NH the lack of access to treatment &amp; it’s not just NH it’s a national problem. https://t.co/BzPj6gfHqG
People who are addicted to opioid pain killers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin. https://t.co/FyfxDv9P2K
