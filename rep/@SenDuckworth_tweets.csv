"We're still the greatest nation in the world, and if anyone has the capacity to overcome the challenges of today, it’s the American people"
"We know we still have a lot work to do as a country, but let us not lose sight of the core values that make our improbable union possible"
Our nation wouldn’t be as strong as it is today w/out the countless individuals who sacrificed to build it—this is what makes American great
"Progress is never a sure thing—it's won through the toil of our Servicemembers, Vets, manufacturers, farmers, teachers&amp; civil rights leaders"
I know that the path forward for our country cannot include—does not include—turning our backs on the shared values that built our nation
"Some may try to convince us the path forward is less engagement with the world, less acceptance of others and less investment in ourselves"
"We might get knocked down, but the America I know—that I fought for and love—does not give up. It's the American way"
"From our founding, the US has faced stark divisions and challenges. But through each trial, we have emerged a more perfect union"
America wasn’t founded as the dominant economic and military force and leader of the free world — the American people built that
"Falling victim to fear&amp; demagoguery will only ensure a weaker America for our children, &amp; that’s not a future I want for my 2yr-old daughter"
These shared values that have helped us to strive toward that more perfect union the Constitution’s framers envisioned
"Though we've occasionally made choices that don't reflect our best selves, we're the greatest nation in the world due to our ideals &amp; values"
