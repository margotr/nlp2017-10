President Trump promised to put workers first. But picking Andrew Puzder to lead @USDOL is another sign he intends to break that promise.
Puzder’s well-known advertisements for CKE restaurants are disgusting &amp; degrading—but his defense of ads is even worse. #AntiLaborSecretary
"Murray, @SenBlumenthal, advocates speaking this morning on why #Puzder can't be trusted to uphold women’s rights in the workplace."
"We cannot afford a WH that accommodates Putin &amp; his meddling in foreign elections, aggression in Ukraine, &amp; record of human rights abuses."
President Trump has remained far too dismissive of Russia’s hostile behavior and Americans deserve to know why that is.
We need an immediate &amp; independent investigation into Russian interference in our elections &amp; potential links btwn Kremlin &amp; Trump campaign.
