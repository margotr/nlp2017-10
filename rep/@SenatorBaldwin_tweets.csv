Wisconsinites are speaking out because health care is deeply personal.
Americans want us to work together to lower costs. No one wants a partisan plan that takes people‚Äôs health care away.
They don‚Äôt want loved ones who depend on #Medicaid for nursing home care to have their care put at risk with caps &amp; cuts. #DontCapMyCare
And they don‚Äôt want bare bones insurance that doesn‚Äôt cover essential services they need.
People with pre-existing conditions don‚Äôt want to be thrown into a high-risk pool or priced out of the coverage they have today.
They don‚Äôt want the #AgeTax or the higher premiums that this plan is offering.
People don't want higher costs for less care.

Or a disabled child who relies on Medicaid funding at school. Who would take health care away from a child?
A loved one who depends on Medicaid for nursing home care. They deserve better.
This will put everyone who depends on Medicaid at risk:
The Senate GOP repeal plan also cuts and caps Medicaid.
"Now, politicians in Madison will decide whether you keep the care you have - or whether it is taken away."
More bad news from the Senate GOP repeal plan: The guaranteed protections and care that you have today are weakened.
"If you have a pre-existing condition or struggle with a sickness, you could be thrown into a high-cost pool that prices you out of coverage."
"If you are older, you could pay an #AgeTax."
It will increase the number of Americans who are uninsured.
It will make families pay more for less care.
"For Wisconsin families struggling to get ahead, the GOP Senate repeal plan has no heart &amp; people are scared it will make things worse."

"If you have a pre-existing condition, the guaranteed protections &amp; care you have today may not be there tomorrow. #TrumpCare"

"#AmericaSpeaksOut because #TrumpCare is ""mean."" Washington should stop leaving people behind and start helping people get ahead."
The people of Wisconsin did not send me to Washington to take people's health care away. They sent me to protect the care they have today.
This is personal to Chelsey in Shelby. She worries about what #TrumpCare will mean for her daughter with a pre-existing condition.
This is personal for Barbara from Madison. Her disabled son relies on Medicaid to work and live independently.
This is personal for Greg from Stoddard who has no idea how older Wisconsinites will be able to afford higher costs for care.
This is personal for Jim from Appleton whose daughter has MS. He told me she needs the ACA so she can receive affordable treatment.
"This isn't just personal for me, it's personal for the Wisconsin families that I work for. I've listened to them &amp; I'm giving them a voice."
"Raising costs for a family with a pre-existing condition isn‚Äôt right, it‚Äôs not fair and it‚Äôs not who we are."
No parent or grandparent should have to lay awake wondering if the health care they have today for their family will be there tomorrow.

"We‚Äôve finally made bipartisan progress on fighting opioid epidemic, but #Trumpcare will take us backwards and make this crisis worse."
#Trumpcare will pull the rug out from under our efforts to address the opioid epidemic in Wisconsin.
"#Trumpcare puts too many people in Wisconsin at risk of losing coverage for substance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery services."
"#Trumpcare will cap and cut Medicaid, increasing health costs to families for substance abuse &amp; mental health services."
"By ending Medicaid as we know it with caps and cuts, #Trumpcare will increase and shift health costs on to Wisconsin and our families."
"#Trumpcare weakens consumer protections in the private insurance market, reduces tax credits for many, and ends Medicaid as we know it."
#Trumpcare repeals the ACA‚Äôs premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies that help lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
#Trumpcare would undermine the recent bipartisan progress to address the opioid epidemic in Wisconsin.
