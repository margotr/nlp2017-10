"McConnell &amp; Ryan would then present this WealthCare bill to Congress for final votes in September, with limited debate and NO amendments."
And even if we do go to a House-Senate conference—like McConnell wants—they would once again be protecting the wealthy behind closed doors.
"In fact, McCarthy is telling members to stick around so they can act before August!"
But don’t be fooled—House Republicans could pass this bad bill right away and it could go directly to the President’s desk.
"In Maryland alone, the #SkinnyRepeal would leave 200,000+ uninsured w/an annual premium increase of $700+."

Trump is shamefully gutting transit investment. Does not understand how important job-creating infrastructure like the TIGER grant is?
This budget and Trumpcare prove Trump is helping his Wall St. friends over hardworking Americans w/ $590B in tax cuts to the wealthy.
"It gives polluters free rein. It ends the cleanup of the Chesapeake, endangering this vital habitat and the livelihood of Marylanders."
"How can Trump provide health insurance for ""everybody"" when Trumpcare cuts Medicaid by $880 billion? This is not who we are."
"A Nation cannot achieve greatness on military might alone, while cutting everything else that we as Americans value."
Trump's budget will hurt hard-working families and deny millions of Americans the opportunity to get the help they need to get ahead.

"There’s no time for excuses, we must act now—strong infrastructure is critical to a strong economy."

"Our blueprint would make critical investments in our roads, bridges, transit, rail, ports, broadband, clean energy, and water systems."
I‘ve joined @SenateDems in introducing a plan to rebuild our nation's crumbling infrastructure and put 15 million Americans to work.
"→ 24% of our roads are in poor condition

→ 1,620 of our bridges need repair

→ 220,000 Maryland students lack basic access to the internet"

Much has changed since 9/11 but our values remain the same. The USA is dedicated to freedom & in the face of adversity we stand together.
Job #1 is to get the economy moving. That is the fastest and most effective way to reduce the deficit in the short-term.
Compromise isn't a dirty word. In fact it's the difference between divided gov that works for the country & dysfunctional gov that doesn't.
"If this committee fails, it won't be for lack of ideas - it will be for lack of political will."
Investing in our infrastructure is a win-win. We would repair aging roads/schools/bridges & create #jobs in a sector with ~14% unemployment.
