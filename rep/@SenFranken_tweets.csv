"That's no way to pass legislation in a democracy, let alone one that could rip insurance from 23M Americans and alter our national economy."

Now more than ever we should be encouraged that there’s special prosecutor to get to bottom of what happened bt Trump’s team &amp; the Russians.
Former Director Comey's testimony makes the case even stronger that the President has continuously tried to undermine that investigation.

"Leanna is the mother of 3-yr-old Henry who is battling leukemia. W/o the #ACA, Henry wouldn’t be able to receive treatment &amp; care he needs."
Megan was dropped from her health coverage when she found out she was pregnant bc it was considered a preexisting condition prior to #ACA.

That won’t do anything to help families scared about #ZikaVirus. Shame on the @SenateGOP for putting politics above doing the right thing.
"Amid a public health crisis, Senate Rs want to defund women’s health, gut the ACA, and fly the Confederate flag on federal cemeteries."
"But Senate Republicans seem to disagree. They jammed a bill to fund the fight against Zika with partisan, dangerous provisions."
The #ZikaVirus is a real threat—not a political talking point—and working to prevent and treat the disease should be bipartisan.
