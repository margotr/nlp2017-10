"In rare ""consumer protection"" vote, Senate GOP prioritizes private money managers over Americans trying to save for retirement."
"W/out GOP rollback of DOL retirement regs, &gt;2M Americans could gain access to new retirement accounts, putting them on more stable footing."

Senate GOP is creating a false choice – Judge Gorsuch or nuclear option – in an attempt to avoid rules change blame. It just doesn't wash.

The revelations are extremely troubling &amp; raise even more questions about the President and his associates’ contacts to #Russia.
The bottom line is we have an obligation to get to the truth. We must evaluate the scope of Russia’s interference in our election.
DOJ Inspector General must immediately begin an investigation into AG #Sessions involvement in the investigation thus far.
"If DOJ refuses to appoint a special prosecutor, we'll urge GOP to work with Dems to create a new, improved independent counsel law."
"DOJ must appoint a special prosecutor who is beyond reproach, completely impartial, w/out any significant ties to either political party."
"Because the Department of Justice should be above reproach, for the good of the country, the Attorney General should resign."
Reports make it clear beyond the shadow of a doubt AG #Sessions cannot possibly lead an investigation into Russian interference in elections
For wks I have said AG #Sessions needs to recuse himself from any investigation into the Trump campaign/transition's contacts w/ #Russia.
I am worried about the future of our country with foreign influence in our elections – it goes to the very wellspring of our democracy.
