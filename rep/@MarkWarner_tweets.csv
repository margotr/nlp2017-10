This investigation will move forward in a bipartisan way. We need to follow the facts wherever they lead.
"For all the denials we’ve heard from the administration, for anyone who’s said there’s smoke but no fire,  I’m curious what they’ll say now."
There are no excuses for what we’ve seen in the last 24 hours. Lying is not a rookie mistake.
"We now know the denials of contacts with Russians that we've heard during the campaign, transition &amp; administration are all patently false."
This is black and white: Trump officials at the highest levels knew Russia was working to aid Donald Trump &amp; welcomed Russia's interference.
That’s why we have to continue this investigation. There’s a lot more work to do.

"With the rise of the part-time, #Freelance, &amp; #GigEconomy workforce, fewer workers are spending their careers at one firm. #AspenIdeas"
Tax credits &amp; capital gains reforms could incentivize reinvestment and reduce outsourcing &amp; short-termism. #AspenIdeas
