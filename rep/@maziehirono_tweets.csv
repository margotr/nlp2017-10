"Never ever be deterred by someone like @realdonaldtrump who doesn’t realize American ideals are bigger than any one man, any one President"
"To all of you who have spoken out- never, ever be deterred by those whose smallness incites them to label you ""Sad!"""
"The patience to understand change rarely comes quickly, yet with the urgency to never stop standing up, never stop speaking out"
"All an activist needs is an undying, unrelenting passion for America, faith in our shared ideals and what I call ""patient urgency"""
But you do not need to go to law school or serve in the Senate to be an activist.
"Today, I am a US Senator. An activist passionate as ever about America &amp; the ideals @realDonaldTrump does not understand"
We decided the best way to make change was to have a voice at the table. I went to law school &amp; got involved in @YoungDemsHI

A strong economic foundation depends on a world class American #education system that prepares our country to compete in the STEM fields.
"As an immigrant, I know the promise America offers and the hopes of those who come to our shores seeking a better life."
we don’t need to do it at the expense of the Diversity Visa Program.
While I believe we should be looking for ways to encourage the best and brightest to come to our shores and create American jobs...
"Democrats and Republicans agree that we should establish a STEM visa program, but unfortunately Republicans inserted a poison pill."
Diversity visas provide a legal path for people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.
It follows the pattern of the Republicans’ approach of giving with one hand while taking with the other.
"Unfortunately, the #STEMjobsAct isn’t the change we need."
"in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields become victims of a broken visa system."
"and the success of American businesses large and small. However, many foreign students who graduate from our best universities"
The ability our nation to attract the world’s best and brightest has contributed greatly to the creation of American jobs...

that keeps our country safe and creates jobs here at home (15/15)
I hope to see a final bill that continues to support our troops and makes sure they have the resources they need (14/15)
That could be a real boost for Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard (13/15)
as well as the Democratic language requiring that U.S.-flagged military ships needing repairs get those repairs here at home (12/15)
My hope is the Senate will address these serious issues and include more job creating and cost-saving measures (11/15)
"Projects like a new missile defense system on that even military leaders oppose or deem unnecessary, should be eliminated (10/15)"
"When so many of our families are still struggling, making sure we take a balanced approach to our debt and budget is vital (9/15)"
"However, like so many of the votes before us in the 112th Congress, this bill contains provisions that raise serious concerns (8/15)"
"including Schofield Barracks, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and Kaneohe Bay (7/15)"
We will also be able to create jobs through the $372 million in construction projects at Hawaii’s military installations (6/15)
"Also, measures to prevent sexual assault in the military were included, which is welcome news (5/15)"
troops receive 1.7 percent pay increase and TRICARE premiums for military retirees will remain tied to cost-of-living adjustment (4/15)
and it’s important for Hawaii (3/15)
I voted for the 2013 NDAA because this bill is important to the servicemen and women of our country and their families (2/15)
Congresswoman Hirono Supports Passage of the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act http://t.co/ijTDWXuR (1/15)
We must remain faithful to our nation’s firmly established rule of law (9/9)
to ensure that the civil liberties and due process guarantees in our Constitution are upheld (8/9)
"While I am disappointed in the result of today’s vote, I will continue fighting (7/9)"
This is not due process. The amendment addressed these major constitutional problems (6/9)
allowing the indefinite detention of an individual in America without charge or trial or requiring military custody is unacceptable (5/9)
The guarantee of due process is one of the most fundamental rights in our country (4/9)
Strengthening our national security should not mean compromising our rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution (3/9)
