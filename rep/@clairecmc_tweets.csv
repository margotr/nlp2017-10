@UnionMargot @jvaragona I DM my constituents constantly.
@lweber89 Not so much. Believe me we wanted to do it for a year.
@Skoumal No. Unlike Bush tax cuts it is paid for. Will not jeopardize SS.
@jvaragona that's what we wanted. Senate Rs insisted on short term deal. I agree with you.
"Rs in house will fiercely fight to prevent taxes going up even a dime on mega wealthy,but ok with taxes going up on working families.Weird."
Huh? Senate votes 89-10!! to make sure taxes don't go up for working folks. House Rs balking. Talk about extreme.
"""If I was in the U.S. Senate,I would fight for a clean up or down vote on extending this tax cut.""says Sarah Steelman.She's right & I am."
"To be clear,the D leader asked consent to vote on the House R bill. The leader of the Rs objected. Please. Let's vote. Need to move forward."
Only in Washington.Republicans in Senate are blocking our ability to vote on the Republican bill from House.Makes no sense.
