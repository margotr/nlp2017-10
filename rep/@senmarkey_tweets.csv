Confirming #RexTillerson as Secretary of State would be turning the keys to U.S. foreign policy over to #BigOil.
To abandon #ParisAgreement would be to abandon #CleanEnergyJobs &amp; #climate action. We cannot roll-back years of progress. #RexTillerson
"Instead of strengthening historic #ParisAgreement, #RexTillerson indicated treaties &amp; agreements would be up for review by @realDonaldTrump"
"#RexTillerson is looking at world thru oil-coated glasses. He may have gotten rid of Exxon’s stock, but he hasn’t gotten rid of co's mindset"
#RexTillerson displayed a lack of understanding of oil’s role in geopolitics -- a result of working solely at Exxon -- that disqualifies him
Stakes w US-Russia relations couldn’t be higher. #RexTillerson’s history at Exxon &amp; Exxon’s holdings in Russia create a conflict of interest
"During #RexTillerson’s time as CEO of @ExxonMobil, the co expanded its drilling rights in Russia to 63M acres - an area the size of Wyoming"
#RexTilleson will not have public's trust unless he agrees to recuse himself from participating in decisions that would affect @ExxonMobil
#MuslimBan is propaganda for ISIS &amp; a recruiting gift for terrorist groups. It will increase the risk of harm to Americans everywhere
