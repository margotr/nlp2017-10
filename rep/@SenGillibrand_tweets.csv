We have an obligation to protect the most vulnerable--that includes making sure survivors of human trafficking can pursue fulfilling lives.
"Survivors of human trafficking are not criminals, they are victims who were preyed on, exploited, &amp; forced into slavery."
Trafficking Survivors Relief Act would vacate convictions of trafficking victims who were forced to break the law while they were trafficked
"Too many survivors of human trafficking, once out of captivity, face barriers to pursuing a normal life incl employment, education &amp; housing"
"Today, joined survivors &amp; advocates to annce my Trafficking Survivors Relief Act to vacate criminal convictions of human trafficking victims"
"#FAMILYAct would guarantee #paidleave for all to care for themselves, a new child, or sick loved one for cost of around a cup of coffee/week"
More than 114 million U.S. workers still lack access to #paidleave for family care. This is unacceptable &amp; is why we need the #FAMILYAct.
".@BLS_gov data shows little change in pvt sector access to employer-provided #paidleave--still just 14% of workers.
