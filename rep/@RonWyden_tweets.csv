Americans must know the answers to these questions.  Nothing could be more in the public interest.
Testimony about whether the President tried to stop an investigation is not classified and must not be relegated to a closed session.
I'd say the hypocrisy is stunning. But I'm not surprised.
DNI says sweeping up calls &amp; emails from American citizens is fine. But figuring out how many of those comms = huge invasion of privacy.
Can the government use Section 702 to collect communications it knows are entirely domestic?
RT @normative: These guys are refusing to answer a lot of questions without invoking either classification or executive privilege.
"Dir. Coats, will you clarify this testimony and tell us the types of targets under Section 702?"

Trump is hurting our security. Allies are already saying they may not share intelligence on threats to Americans.
"Further, naming a politician as FBI Director would be a grave mistake &amp; an insult to the rule of law &amp; the men &amp; women of the FBI."
The president’s actions have made a special counsel necessary. Absolutely no FBI Dir should be considered until special counsel is appointed
This kind of disclosure could harm national security by jeopardizing important sources of information needed to disrupt terrorist attacks.

#Gorsuch’s record is fraught with secret law &amp; favoring the powerful over the powerless. He should not be confirmed.
#Gorsuch fails to recognize that rights are reserved to the people. Not corporations or the government.
#Gorsuch’s failure to put the Constitution &amp; the law first disqualifies him from the Supreme Court.
"At the Department of Justice, #Gorsuch practiced secret law. He justified &amp; proposed government violations of the law prohibiting torture."
Gorsuch is locked in to an extreme right-wing viewpoint on death with dignity &amp; many other views.
Death with Dignity was passed to protect citizens private choices from government interference.
Gorsuch wrote an entire book attacking the right to make end-of-life choices like Oregon’s Death with Dignity law.
Gorsuch has demonstrated hostility toward the right of individuals to make decisions about their own lives w/out interference from the state
"Our Constitution is a document of constraints that limit the government, not the people."
Originalism = political agenda whose sole intent is reserving power for the powerful &amp; limiting recognition of rights reserved to the people
“Originalism” is a political agenda masquerading as a judicial philosophy.

Here are the questions @SenateFinance Democrats want answers to from Price &amp; Mnuchin https://t.co/jo2NOyq484
The public deserves to know exactly who we are trusting with #Medicare &amp; our economy.
"I sincerely hope, for Americans' sake, @SenateGOP will put partisanship aside &amp; join us in pressing for the answers."
"Mnuchin also misled the Committee on his shady foreclosure practices that forced many Americans, sometimes illegally, out of their homes."
Price's stock trades &amp; the Qs we STILL don't have answers to undermine the belief he can work on behalf of the public interest &amp; not his own
"Today, for the 1st time in history, Senate Finance Cmte broke the rules to push through, on a partisan basis, 2 nominees who misled the Cmte"
"No senator who believes individual rights are reserved to the people, not the government, can support Gorsuch’s nomination."
Gorsuch harkens back to the days when politicians restricted a people’s rights on a whim. That is a very dangerous view to our liberty.
Gorsuch represents a breathtaking retreat from the notion that Americans have fundamental Constitutional rights.

Oversight is a key check on executive power. Much harder to do that job when conflicts of interest are intentionally hidden from view.
