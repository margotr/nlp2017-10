I am outraged that a company almost wholly unaccountable to the public could wreak so much havoc on innocent people.
"Then we learn that some top Equifax Execs sold the company’s shares just days after the incident, making $1.8M in profits!"
"This means that if every American affected paid the fee, Equifax could make more than $1B (not a typo, that’s a B)"
"And if those affected want to freeze their credit in order to protect themselves, they have to pay Equifax a $5-$10 fee"
"Equifax then tried to sneakily take away the victim’s right to sue, only to reverse that decision after severe public outrage"
"Equifax apparently wasted those 6 weeks, failing to figure out how to best help the citizens they put in danger of identity/credit theft."
What’s jaw-dropping is that it took Equifax 6 weeks to inform the public that the breach even happened &amp; that they were at extreme risk
"First, Equifax is one of the nation's 3 credit reporting agencies so the security breach there is a huge deal that requires immediate action"
