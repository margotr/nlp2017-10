One way to commemorate these heroes of history - and #BlackHistoryMonth - would be to pass the End Racial &amp; Religious Profiling Act.
Those who endured discrimination in silence; those who fought for civil rights without recognition.
And let's remember that many who deserve celebrating this #BlackHistoryMonth will never have their name in a history book:
"#BlackHistory is American history. The contributions of Black activists, inventors, artists and entrepreneurs have benefited us all."

Nonpartisan @USCBO numbers don't lie. Repealing #ACA without a replacement plan would be financially devastating and morally irresponsible.

The nonpartisan @USCBO today said repealing the #ACA would lead to major premium hikes for all. 20% to 25% in the first year after repeal.
The CBO calculates the effects of an #ACA repeal would be even worse by 2026: 32 million uninsured. 32 million reasons to oppose repeal.

#S1140 makes the  @USDA the arbiter of hydrological science. Now their a great agency but that's not their job.

I'm voting NO."
