"Republicans are about to vote for their health care bill. Among those who know it's bad: doctors, nurses, hospitals, the public, Republicans"
My R colleagues just released their bill to redo America's h/care system. At 9:53 at night. And they want to vote on it in a couple hours.
"Let's be honest. This disastrous, fraudulent (their words) GOP health care bill isn't going to get better in a conference w the House."
"Let's work together. Let's hold hearings. Let's hear from doctors, nurses, patients. Let's try. Let's do the right thing."
That's no way to remake our healthcare system. I think we should heed the advice of Senator McCain and go back to regular order.
"Earlier tonight, 4 of my GOP colleagues said this bill was a 'disaster' &amp; a 'fraud,' but that they could try to fix it if they just pass it"
All we know right now is that every single GOP proposal that’s been brought forward has two features: reduced coverage and higher costs.

If Republicans want to dismantle Obamacare – they ought to tell us what their plan is – but they’re keeping the public in the dark
Health care is too important for secrecy – we’re talking about the lives and health care of millions of Americans here!
"I wasn’t in the Senate in 2009, but I remember well the 100+ hearings, meetings, roundtables, &amp; amendments to the #ACA"
Let’s be clear: the GOP ‘health care plan’ would mean 14 million+ Americans lose Medicaid coverage
"The news may be focused elsewhere, but the biggest story in the Senate is the closed-door, secretive process to dismantle our h/care system"
Senate Ds &amp; Rs should work TOGETHER on moving forward to get a better health care system for all Americans.
There have been no public hearings or debates about the GOP health care bill. That’s ridiculous https://t.co/rnmAXRZCyc

I oppose these severe cuts to federally sponsored research.
Investments in R&amp;D are critical to maintaining our competitiveness &amp; improving American lives.
"Sustained economic growth is not a possibility if we do not invest in R&amp;D and innovation that allow us to compete, prosper, and be secure."
"American leadership is built on investments in departments like NASA, DOE, NSF, NIH, &amp; many others."
I am very concerned about cuts to R&amp;D and innovation in the Trump budget which are critical to American competitiveness.
Our president should make our country stronger &amp; safer. But his #budget &amp; proposed cuts to diplomacy &amp; development would do the opposite.
"MEP centers, TIGER Program, Meals on Wheels, EPA programs = all eliminated under Trump's #budget."
"Trump's #budget would threaten our security, our economy, our environment &amp; our global leadership. I'll fight against this shortsightedness."
This isn't what @POTUS promised. Jeopardizing the health care of millions is a terrible move for our country.
Trump's #budget calls for $6B in cuts to #NIH &amp; $1.3B in cuts to #CDC. This is a huge step backwards in health care &amp; research.

Some saying #ACA repeal necessary for US fiscal health. False. Budget resolution will increase nat'l debt by nearly $10 trillion over 10 yrs
The bottom line is that #ACA has helped millions of Americans access high-quality coverage. Trumpcare is an empty promise. It's that simple.
Dems have been clear that #ACA is not perfect. That’s why we've spent 6 yrs trying to find R's willing to work together to improve the law.
