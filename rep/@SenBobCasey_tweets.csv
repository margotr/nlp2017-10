Thank you @JoshShapiroPA for fighting @realDonaldTrump’s sabotage of our health care system. https://t.co/qCppowHXi8
I will review @realDonaldTrump strategy &amp; legislative proposals but will not support something that would violate the Iran nuclear agreement
The U.S. should not walk away from Iran nuclear agreement
JCPOA represents best available option for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability &amp; enhancing visibility of program
"While I look forward to reviewing @realDonaldTrump Iran strategy, his decision not to make certifications could imperil JCPOA"

"Instead of hurting families and seniors, they should work in a bipartisan way to improve our health care system."
"These schemes have been soundly rejected, yet the Administration is now trying to enact them via executive order."
"They have put forth legislative schemes that would drive up premiums, increase costs and reduce protections."
They have a maniacal obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act. That obsession is harming families across the nation.
"This executive order is trying to return us to the days when you could buy junk insurance – it was cheap, because it didn’t cover much."
"Instead, @POTUS and Republicans in Congress have engaged in a sabotage of our health care system, which has driven up premiums and costs."
"For nine months, the Admin &amp; congressional Republicans have abdicated their basic obligation to make sure our health care system works."
This is a sabotage of our health care system by executive order. https://t.co/s6uIsQXxh4

Small business can already write off $500K in investments b/c of work @SenatorCollins &amp; I did in 2015 to make the 179 deduction permanent
Republican plan gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporations; their budget cuts Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion.
"Fact Check - According to non-partisan @USCBO, profitable corporations have an effective tax rate of 18.6%."
"Worth more than $11 million? No? Guess what, the estate tax does not apply to you."
"Repealing the estate tax would give $27 billion a year to America’s 5,500 richest families."
".@POTUS says tax cuts go to the middle class. Fact Check: top 0.1% (income above $3,439,900) get an avg tax cut of $747,580 in 2018."
"Under the Republican plan, a family of four would gain $11,300 in standard deduction, and simultaneously LOSE $16,200 in personal exemptions"
Tax on a single piece of paper? We already have it. It’s called the 1040EZ
"Fact Check: Average tax cut for the top 1% is $146,470. Plan INCREASES the tax rate from 10% to 12% on family income below $18,650."
"Oh and increasing the tax rate on family income below $18,650 from 10% to 12% 🙄"
How do they make up the rest? With $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. https://t.co/fVLsVVyWZg
Their own budget reconciliation bill allows them to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. That’s a lot of zeros. https://t.co/7deyiHKzZw
So does the GOP place any value in reducing the deficit? Let’s take a look at their budget.
".@JoeBiden has said ""Don’t tell me what you value, show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you value."""
"In total, the GOP tax plan gives almost 3 trillion in tax cuts to wealthy Americans and profitable corporations over the next 10 years."
That’s equivalent to the total annual funding for Pell grants ($22.5 billion FY17) and WIC ($6.35 billion).
Repealing the estate tax would reduce revenue by roughly $27 billion/year.
"That’s equal to entire FY17 budget for the @CDCgov ($7.2B), the FAA ($16.4B), the @TSA ($7.78) and the @USCG ($10.45B)."
The GOP’s purposed changes to the top individual tax bracket will reduce revenue by about $42 billion/year.
"That’s equal to the entire FY17 budget for the @NIH ($34.1 billion), @CustomsBorder ($14.3 billion), and @FEMA ($11.6 billion) combined."
The purposed GOP cuts for Pass-through/S-corps will reduce revenue by roughly $60 billion/year.
"That’s equal to our military’s annual personnel costs (salary, healthcare, retirement contributions, etc) PLUS NASA’s entire annual budget."
Let’s start with the proposed cut to the corporate tax rate: $1.5 trillion over 10 years or $150 billion/year.
So just how much would we have to cut to keep the deficit the same? Take a look at the numbers.
"How, you ask? By definition, tax cuts reduce revenue. If you don't make cuts equal to that reduction, you increase the deficit."
Republicans are now proposing to wipe that away with a budget and tax plan that will drastically increase the deficit.
"In 2011, under the Budget Control Act Republicans and Democrats came to an agreement on $1 trillion in deficit reduction measures."
There are only two ways to reduce the deficit: bring in more revenue or decrease spending.
Thread #2: The GOP talks a lot about the importance of reducing our national budget deficit.
The only ones who benefit from the GOP pass-through rate reduction are the super-rich hedge fund managers and real… https://t.co/CWOpPkIJfM
Most small businesses using pass-through already pay less than the proposed GOP rate. https://t.co/dpn7TfYRho
"GOP tries to sell the ‘pass-through’ loophole as being good for small business, yet 90% of the benefits go to the top 1%."
"This is why @realDonaldTrump's budget is ""out of whack,"" not because a hurricane devastated Puerto Rico."
"That’s right, this hedge fund manager loophole dwarfs the entire budget of the primary department responsible for responding to emergencies."
"In context, this new loophole = FY17 budgets of NIH, Customs &amp; Border Protection &amp; FEMA COMBINED."
"Changing the pass-through rate will lower taxes for hedge fund managers &amp; real estate developers, adding $600B to the deficit over 10 years."
This new loophole is accomplished through something called a ‘pass-through.’
"First up, a look at how this plan creates new, special loopholes for super-rich hedge fund managers &amp; wealthy real estate developers."
"And throughout the day on Twitter, I'll address some of the more egregious flaws in this tax plan."
"Today in Philadelphia, I'll highlight how the GOP tax plan also RAISES taxes on the middle class to help fund these same giveaways."
"Yesterday, I met with seniors in Lancaster to highlight how this plan cuts Medicare to fund giveaways to super-rich. https://t.co/hXUba0oZWn"
"Today, @realDonaldTrump will come to Pennsylvania to push tax plan that gives 80% of benefits to the top 1% of the county."

But Graham-Cassidy isn't about improving health care for Americans and never has been.
The sham process underway for Graham-Cassidy would be inexplicable if the purpose was to actually improve our health care system
Can they guarantee that PA seniors won't be impacted by cuts to nursing home care? How about the impact on  individuals w/ a disability?
Can the backers of Graham-Cassidy guarantee that Pennsylvanians won't lose their insurance under their scheme? That premiums won't rise?

"Today our nation mourns for Heather Heyer, who was murdered in yesterday’s domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, and her family."
Our nation must stand together and condemn this racism and those who promote it.

"For people with disabilities, slashing Medicaid is anti-freedom. It’s not a key. It’s a prison."
Don’t be fooled by empty promises and lofty rhetoric about health care and freedom. Slashing Medicaid doesn’t give anyone freedom.
"They would set disabilities rights back decades, back to institutions."
The Republican health care bills will take away that freedom and liberty.
"Medicaid, coupled with legislative and judicial victories, represents freedom and liberty to people with disabilities."
Medicaid helps people with disabilities to go to work. To live in their communities. To have families.
The Medicaid program was the financial support that made those hard won rights something tangible and real.
"The Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, the Olmstead decision were all critical advances in the right to self-determination."
The last 50 years have been a period of steady progress for people with disabilities.  They have fought for and won their liberty.
"Robbed of their freedom, their right to self-determination, and usually put in horrific institutions to rot."
"For much of history, people with disabilities were treated as less than human."
"This is a perversion, especially when considering the impact on the rights of people with disabilities.  Some history is helpful here."
"They say that getting rid of the health care of tens of millions is, perversely, consistent with American value of self-determination."

This is the exact kind of bribe I warned you about. https://t.co/TxYKIiKjei
My Senate Republican colleagues will have to choose. Judge them on their choice.
There are no amount of deliberately misleading statements or slush funds that can change that.
"Are they going to cut care for 20 million and raise premiums for millions more, or are they not?"
"They are counting on your confusion, but it's really a simple question."
"Are you going to vote to jack up premiums, cut coverage for millions, impose an age tax on older workers and decimate Medicaid?"
"At the end of the week, my Senate Republican colleagues will have a bottom line decision to make."
"This obscene bill is fatally flawed, something that hammers the middle class so severely can’t be tweaked."
"This health care scheme will be a wrecking ball for middle-class families, children, seniors and individuals with disabilities."
"We won’t fall for their nonsense, their slush funds, their state specific giveaways, their do-nothing fixes."
"What Senate Republicans are counting on is that you, the American people, get fooled."
But they will allow Republicans Senators to blow hot air and tell their constituents they fixed a problem when the opposite is true.
There will be legislative slush funds for specific Senators. These slush funds won’t make health care more affordable.
"That's a scam, here’s a study to prove it. https://t.co/3CzlykNOrP"
There will be an amendment for a Medicaid slush fund that the @SenateGOP claims will help those who will lose Medicaid coverage.
"Don’t be fooled, here’s an expert who disproves that a fund is a substitute for coverage. https://t.co/OLz7qZVtqv."
The coverage that they will lose when Medicaid is decimated.
"People confronting substance abuse don’t need some fund from Washington, they need coverage-"
"Over the next few days, you’ll see an amendment for a slush fund that Senators will claim helps fight the opioid crisis. It won’t."
"Here's what they're betting on: that they can continue to scheme in secret, behind closed doors, cut deals, bribe Senators with slush funds."
"Well, today they did and, sadly, I am not shocked."
"For weeks, some of my Republican colleagues said they would never vote to move forward on a repeal bill without a replacement."
"Approximately 20 million people lose coverage, Medicaid is decimated through cuts, older workers pay an age tax and premiums increase."
But here are the facts: in every scheme put forth by Congressional Republicans-
We’ve heard it all: “health care for everyone” “no one will lose Medicaid” (cc @SecPriceMD)
They have a strategy: confuse. deliberately mislead. lie.
"So stuck between their ideological obsession &amp; the will of the American people, Congressional Republicans have chosen to charge forward."
"Americans want Congress to work in a bipartisan way to improve our health care, not scheme in private to strip health care away for millions"
They had a big problem though: the protections put in place by the ACA are popular.
"Since November, Congressional Republicans have tried to fulfill their long-held ideological obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act"

"Well, we’re not going to stand for it. We will not push people back into institutions where people with disabilities are unseen and unheard."
It will turn Medicaid into a program of waiting lists and will push people back into institutions.
Per capita caps will take a knife to state Medicaid budgets.
And make no mistake about it—the proposal to cap the Medicaid reimbursement is another type of cut.
These cuts will fracture an already fragile delivery system that supports aging Americans and those with disabilities.
These cuts will mean great direct service workers who help support people with disabilities will likely lose their jobs.
These cuts will make it impossible for those who need to purchase a wheel chair or an augmentative speaking device.
These cuts will harm hundreds of thousands Pennsylvanians and millions of Americans.
These cuts are tax cuts for the rich. Hiding behind a phrase like “original intent” is cowardly and ignores the real harm they will do.
They say these cuts will bring the Medicaid program back to its original intent. That’s a bold-faced lie.
The @HouseGOP has proposed an immoral $834 billion cut to Medicaid. @realDonaldTrump's budget proposed a $600 billion cut on top of that.

Shame on @realDonaldTrump @Reince45 @DHSgov @ICEgov for turning their back on this child and his mother. They should be better than this.

".@realDonaldTrump should focus @DHSgov on keeping us safe. Target criminals for deportation, focus on security- not on a 5yr old."
This child and his mother deserved better from this Administration. They got the absolute worst.
"We may never find out what happens to this child &amp; his mother, but their fates should weigh on the conscious of this Administration."
The gang who threatened the life of this child and mother won't waste time in seeking to mete out their revenge.
The latest on the 5yr old &amp; his mother: it's very likely that they are on the ground in Honduras and that's a potential death sentence.

Just confirmed with @DHSgov: only the White House can order this reversed now. It's on @Reince45 &amp; @realDonaldTrump to help this family.
Why? Because that's the tone @realDonaldTrump has set- one in which pushing out a 5yr old and his mother is somehow a good idea.
"Yup, that's right @DHSgov likely knew paperwork was in hand &amp; rushed removal just because they could."
Worst part: According to lawyers @DHSgov knew darn well that 5yr old &amp; mother had secured paperwork to protect them &amp; they rushed removal.
"Admin refuses to tell me whether they were placed on a direct flight or one with a layover. Infuriating. @flightaware is interesting, fwiw"
If 5yr old &amp; mother are on the direct flight it may be too late. Working the phones to try to find out which flight they're on.
"If this 5yr old and his mother are on the flight with a layover, then the Admin can still save them from this potential death sentence."
The latest: Admin ordered the family on the plane. There are two flights they could be on: one direct to Honduras another with a layover.
"Just got off the phone with @Reince45, he promised that they are looking into it. I'll hold him accountable to do the right thing."
.@DHSgov #dotherightthing
What I won't do: stand by silently as a vulnerable child and his mother are sent to their possible death.
"I've voted to double the number of border patrol agents, add 700 miles of fencing and mandate 24-hour surveillance of the border."
I've voted to secure our border and fix our immigration system.
.@DHSgov know the stakes for this child and his mother. Do the right thing.
"Instead of sending a 5yr old and mother back to possible death, @realDonaldTrump should focus on dangerous criminals."
.@DHSgov and @realDonaldTrump should work to actually secure our border and fix our immigration system and stop this nonsense.
We shouldn't turn our back on a vulnerable 5yr old boy and his mother who may very well die if they get on that plane.
They came to the U.S. because they believed in what's on the Statue of Liberty- they believed in the promise of this nation.
"This 5yr old and his mother aren't 'bad hombres.' They aren't in a gang, they're running from death- vulnerable and scared."
.@realDonaldTrump If you're on twitter- Call @DHSgov Sec. Kelly and tell him this makes no sense.
I've just placed a call to @DHSgov Sec. telling him to stop this. I need you to tweet @DHSgov &amp; tell them to protect this mother and child.
"I just had a picture of this 5yr old come across my desk. He's adorable and wrote that he had ""nowhere to go."""
"The gangs will target this mother and her child the moment they land in Honduras, yet Trump admin insists on this cruel policy."
"Despite that, the Trump admin is planning to put them on a plane TODAY. A plane ride that can very likely lead to their death."
"Targeted for death, this mother fled with her 5yr old child. The child is potentially eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status."
Here's their story: the 5yr old's mother witnessed the murder of her cousin in Honduras and was being pursued by gangs.
This mother &amp; child are being held at a facility in Berks county &amp; are being sent into danger despite the child being eligible for relief.
Twitter: it's urgent. I just found out that a young child &amp; her mother who came to U.S. seeking refuge will be sent back to Honduras today.
It appears the new @HouseGOP health care amendment is just an $8 billion scheme to strip protections from those with pre-existing conditions

I stand in solidarity w/ Egypt's Christian community following today's heinous attacks.
"When China cheats, PA loses. It's disappointing @realDonaldTrump failed to negotiate measurable change in China's behavior during summit."
I was critical of President Bush &amp; @POTUS44 for failing to hold China accountable on trade &amp; was hopeful @realDonaldTrump would do so.
.@realDonaldTrump summit w/ China's President was all talk and no action when it comes to China's cheating on trade
"Last week I wrote @POTUS and identified areas where China is cheating on trade: overcapacity, currency manipulation, steel dumping"
"During his summit w/ China's President, @POTUS failed to hold China accountable for cheating on trade"
Assad's ability to terrorize Syrians is directly related to support from Russia/Iran. @POTUS must stand up to both. #SyriaStrikes
In short: strikes appropriate but larger strategy needed. Further action requires authorization. @POTUS should rescind his travel ban today
Further action by @POTUS in Syria requires authorization from Congress. I called for an AUMF under @POTUS44 as well. #SyriaStrikes
.@POTUS should immediately rescind his discriminatory travel ban so Syrian refugees can resettle after appropriate vetting #SyriaStrikes
.@POTUS was rightly moved by images of attacks on Syrians but his travel ban prevents those same people from resettling here #SyriaStrikes
Part of @POTUS' strategy on Syria should be to accelerate humanitarian assistance #SyriaStrikes
"While last night's strikes were appropriate, @POTUS must lay out a comprehensive strategy on both Syria &amp; ISIS #SyriaStrikes"
There is no purely military solution to the conflict in Syria &amp; I oppose large scale deployment of U.S. ground forces #SyriaStrikes
It's incumbent upon @POTUS to outline a strategy for how last night's strikes move us closer to political transition in Syria #SyriaStrikes
Last night's targeted strikes against Assad regime were appropriate &amp; proportionate #SyriaStrikes
"Can't make this up: @SpeakerRyan's new health care plan is  an ""invisible risk sharing program"" These guys.... https://t.co/dA8CkNYn4o"
After my review it was clear that Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy would stack the deck against workers &amp; families #StopGorsuch
"I had concerns about the process for nominating Judge Gorsuch but I met w/ him, reviewed his record- that's advise and consent #StopGorsuch"
These stats don't even account for the outrageous treatment of Merrick Garland by @SenateGOP #StopGorsuch
Think about that: over half of all motions to cut off debate on nominations in U.S. history were forced by @SenateGOP under @BarackObama
"Under @BarackObama, @SenateGOP required motions to cut off debate on 79 nominations- over 50 percent of all nominations in U.S. history"
From nation's founding through @POTUS44 first term: motion to cut off debate filed on just 147 nominations.
Judge Gorsuch is too extreme for scotus but we should also talk about how we got here (I.e 'nuclear option by Senate Rs) #StopGorsuch
"Judge Gorsuch's legal philosophy is disconnected from the everyday lives of Americans. Workers need justice, not some theory #StopGorsuch"
Current scotus ruled 8-0 against Judge Gorsuch's legal theory concerning children w/ disabilities. He's out of the mainstream. #StopGorsuch
"A trench worker, a trucker driver were protected by other courts but Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy led him to rule for corporations"
@realDonaldTrump should never have selected a nominee from a list provided by far right groups like Heritage Foundation/Federalist Society
Under the Roberts Court big corporations too often win out over workers. Judge Gorsuch would exacerbate this trend. #StopGorsuch
Judge Gorsuch has a rigid judicial philosophy which leads him to come down on the side of powerful interests/big corporations #StopGorsuch
To prevent scotus from moving further in the direction of big corporations we must #StopGorsuch. Watch now: https://t.co/sMFm7crMwu
Heading down to the Senate floor in a few minutes to talk about why Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy is far too extreme for scotus

"Why? Since January 1st, over 80,000 Pennsylvanians have written me with concerns about Russia. They want answers, I do too."
".@realDonaldTrump will continue his attempts to distract us from getting to the bottom of this, but we can't let that happen."
So the key issue here is the growing body of reporting on the #Trumprussia connections.
To be clear – it is one thing for a sitting NSA to ask that individuals in intel reports be “unmasked” – that’s very different than leaking.
"Enter the ‘unmasking’ issue. If a NatSec Advisor saw something concerning in intel &amp; didn't ask questions, they wouldn't be doing their job."
"With the wiretap claim debunked by... EVERY credible stakeholder, team Trump moves on to the next one."
To the point where @realDonaldTrump tweets a blatant fabrication about being 'wiretapped' by @POTUS44.
"More questions about #Trumprussia, more distractions from @realDonaldTrump."
Distract from what? @RepAdamSchiff can explain it better than I can: https://t.co/TTTPBONbHT
"Blame a 400lb guy in his basement, blame @POTUS44, blame @HillaryClinton, blame the media, blame @AmbassadorRice."
".@realDonaldTrump should want to get to the bottom of Russia's meddling no matter what. Instead, it's dodge, distract, and deny."
Let that sink in if you haven't already- that's a gravely serious matter for our nation.
"Reminder: The FBI is investigating possible collusion between the sitting President, his campaign, his associates and a foreign power."
"In case it wasn't obvious, this whole discussion of 'unmasking' is a classic @realDonaldTrump distraction from the FBI investigation."
"So the #Trumprussia investigation and ""unmasking."" I have some thoughts."

Office of Gov Ethics agrees: @realDonaldTrump financial conflicts of interest are untenable. He must divest https://t.co/NpMn0xVx1C
His vote against an amendment simply expressing that immigrants should not be banned from this country based on their religion is offensive.
"On the critically important issue of voting rights, I am deeply troubled by his record as a federal prosecutor and a U.S. Senator."
I have significant concerns regarding U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions’ nomination to serve as Attorney General.
...not one whose own financial interests lurk behind his decisions.
Pennsylvanians deserve a President who will fight for the middle class and those trying to get there.
.@realDonaldTrump has virtually guaranteed that he will face decisions that impact his own personal financial interests.
"Instead of solving his financial conflicts of interest, @realDonaldTrump has deepened them."
I was hopeful that @realDonaldTrump would use this press conf. to announce his complete divestment from financial conflicts of interest.
We will miss President Obama’s principled leadership and enduring commitment to strengthening America.
"We have made progress but we still face substantial challenges in order to grow incomes, educate more children and keep our nation safe."
Our nation and state are in a stronger position today than when President Obama took the oath of office in January 2009.
President Obama was a strong fighter for the middle class and the vulnerable.
"Over 15 million jobs created, 20 million more Americans with health care and a $1 trillion reduction in the deficit."
His achievements as President are too numerous to list but three are significant:
"From the first time we met in 2005, I was struck by his integrity, his intellect and his decency."
"On this night when President Obama delivers his Farewell Address, I want to commend him for his eight years of dedicated public service."
"Without a full &amp; complete divestment, the American people will not be able to tell where the Trump Org ends &amp; where the Trump Admin begins."
If @realDonaldTrump announces anything short of full divestment tomorrow he will leave a cloud of suspicion hanging over his Administration.
"These entanglements are deeply concerning, which is why we introduced the Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act. https://t.co/m4hCzHQIg0"

Stephen Bannon is someone who has demonstrated disregard for common decency and values that all Americans should share.
Trump has pledged to be a President for all Americans; placing this individual in a position of such significant power undermines that claim
I am deeply troubled that President-elect Trump has appointed Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor.
Saddened to hear of the passing of Gwen Ifill. She was an exceptional journalist who brought integrity and fairness to her reporting.
The President of the United State must lead with moral authority and denounce racism and bigotry in the strongest terms.
