May we remember folk in prison are still part of our society; we are defined by how we treat them and how we offer them hope for redemption.
"From the warden to the incarcerated women who advocated for issues of no direct benefit to them, today I saw the power of tireless love."
"Again, I am grateful for those - especially at today's prison - who pour their heart into their work and affirm human dignity."
America is paying too high a price for a broken criminal justice system that harms too much &amp; helps too little. We must all demand better.
"Women face unique challenges in prison. Thanks to insights from the warden, staff &amp; women I listened to, I'll step up my fight for reform."
"We must also do a better job focusing on the reality that so many of the people we incarcerate, especially women, are survivors of traumas."
"Our criminal justice system is broken, you see it up close visiting prisons; from excessive sentencing to lack of resources for reentry."
"I'm grateful to the professionals who work there - corrections officers, medical staff &amp; more - who do hard &amp; difficult work for our nation."
Just finished a visit to another Federal Prison. I visited for many reasons including to learn more about issues facing incarcerated women.

Trump is wrong: It's not economy vs environment or America vs the world. It's future vs past; progress &amp; opportunity vs retreat &amp; surrender.

"@beardtalk Not just ""you guys"" but you too. Nice chatting with you as well. Have a good night and I wish you the best."
@beardtalk May we both be the change: eat for our environment/volunteer for others/be conscious consumers/stay enegaged &amp; be kind to others
"@beardtalk Always, always hold us to high standards, heck hold everyone to them including yourself. We need each other at our best."
@beardtalk I can't defend all... there is a lot of serious challenges coming at us under Trump. Just don't throw all of us into one bucket.
"@beardtalk At what level u think they start 2 sell out? Sincerely, reach out to some, when I was a young activist many actually met with me."
