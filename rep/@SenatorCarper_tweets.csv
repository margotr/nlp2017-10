All Americans deserve that peace of mind. https://t.co/kMLuBX6vDF
Can House GOP explain why members of Congress are the only people entitled to protections for preexisting conditions under AHCA?
What we don‚Äôt know is the damage AHCA will have on middle class families and our economy because House GOP plan to vote without a CBO score.
"We know that AHCA puts Americans back at the mercy of insurance companies, which will choose who can get covered &amp; what that coverage costs."
We know that AHCA will kick more than 20 million Americans off their health insurance plans.
Happening soon in the Senate: a vote on a CRA that will make it harder for Americans to save for retirement. I'm voting NO. #SaveRetirement

"An amazing coalition of stakeholders support a long-term transportation bill, and their message to us is the same: #FixTheTrustFund"
Now is the time to act. Gas prices this weekend will be lower than any Memorial Day in recent memory. #FixTheTrustFund
The 18.3 cent federal gas tax we set in 1993 is now worth about a dime. The 24.3 cent diesel tax is worth about 15 cents. #FixTheTrustFund
It‚Äôs like taking a road trip and filling your car with gas one gallon at a time. It‚Äôs no way to run a country. #FixTheTrustFund
Sen. Boxer and I have introduced a measure that we hope will lead to a long-term solution this summer. #FixTheTrustFund
Short-term patches have been justified by saying we need just a little more time. But we've come no closer to a solution. #FixTheTrustFund
The Framers of the Constitution had the sense say it is the role of the government to provide transportation systems. #FixTheTrustFund
"You have to plan, fund, contract, and get permits for transportation projects. It takes years. #FixTheTrustFund"
"Short-term extensions undermine governors and mayors around the country, preventing investments in critical projects. #FixTheTrustFund"
"Since 2008, we haven‚Äôt had a transportation bill lasting more than 2 years. Some have lasted as little as a few days. #FixTheTrustFund"
"Infrastructure is how we move people and goods, and it‚Äôs the key to an efficient and growing economy. #FixTheTrustFund"
