But we can change this. Programs like Generation Art Space are taking important steps to help Native children overcome challenges they faced

Kids who have 4+ traumatic experiences have 3X the lifetime risk of heart disease &amp; lung cancer and a 20-year difference in life expectancy

I have many ideas that I’ll keep offering. I’m hopeful there is now an opening for progress. My office door remains wide open.
"For years I’ve said the health reform law isn’t perfect, no law ever is – but we can make it work thru needed reforms"
"GOP &amp; Dems should be able to join together to pass transparent, bipar. reforms to improve health care, as I’ve been working to accomplish"
"Many hoped this bill would pass for political reasons, instead it failed for the right reasons - it hurt our neighbors &amp; communities"
History will remember where each of us stood during this vote. We should be here to do what is best for the American people.
I could not support a bill that was crafted behind closed doors &amp; would have ripped health care away from tens of thousands of NDans
