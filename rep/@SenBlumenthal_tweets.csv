Congress must act immediately to spare Americans from the devastating impact of Trump’s horrific healthcare sabotage.
"Disgraceful that Pres. Trump is undercutting Americans' healthcare in service of misguided, myopic crusade against ACA. Not leadership."
"Brazen and baffling – Trump’s ending of ACA subsidies means higher premiums, destabilized markets, and pain for working families."
"ACA is law of the land. President Trump should work w/ both parties on improvements, instead of using regular Americans as political pawns."
I urge @DHSGov Inspector Gen. to quickly investigate Trump Admin handling of Puerto Rico relief. No excuse for self-promotion &amp; subterfuge.
"We need full truth about situation in Puerto Rico, not self-promotional videos that sugarcoat catastrophic crisis on the ground."
Americans need to know whether the Trump Administration is truly focused on helping millions of citizens suffering in Puerto Rico.
Congress must rescue health care from Trump sabotage. Onward Sens. Alexander &amp; Murray. Bipartisan work is our only hope.
"Mean-spirited, rash, irrational - Trump's ending critical ACA subsidies shreds health care protections and shatters promises."
Trump's sabotage of ACA seems boundless - a health care tragedy unfolding for countless Americans.
Must do much more to hold Iran accountable for other malign actions. President has failed to do so. This misstep will make that even harder.
Nothing changed since President twice notified Congress that preventing a nuclear-armed Iran through agreement was in our national interest.
Failure to certify Iran Agreement today undermines America’s credibility with allies and jeopardizes ability to hold Iran accountable.
"After emergency relief and rescue, we need long-term Marshall plan crafted by disaster relief czar partnering w/ Puerto Rican leaders."
Fellow Americans are dying. The island is devastated. Federal efforts are grossly inadequate. A disaster relief czar must take charge.
"Humanitarian crisis, calamity &amp; chaos in Puerto Rico are why I'm demanding a disaster relief czar - to cut through red tape &amp; deliver help."
RT @washingtonpost: The Post's Editorial Board: The misery in Puerto Rico is completely unacceptable https://t.co/o9dTJEBtdp
Disaster relief czar – appointed by President – vitally necessary to mobilize immediate aid and organize long-term recovery efforts.
We cannot tolerate double standard of disaster relief. Puerto Rico needs capable federal response to deepening humanitarian crisis.
"We need disaster relief czar to cut through red tape, work with local leaders, and ensure Puerto Ricans receive essential supplies."
Puerto Rico deserves a disaster relief czar to coordinate federal response - on the verge of failing millions of fellow Americans.

"Americans spoke loud and clear: We should strengthen the ACA, not sabotage it. Pres. Trump should listen to them instead of the far right."

"The Trump admin will stop at nothing to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, no matter how many Americans are hurt. https://t.co/2n9Pgf0Elg"
Trump's threats to cease active aid for Puerto Rico reflect a double standard of disaster relief. America is about to fail fellow Americans.
"I saw a Puerto Rico struggling w devastation&amp;death in dire need of FEMA, military&amp;federal relief. Mr. President, it's a humanitarian crisis."
Abandoning Puerto Rico now by withdrawing FEMA would be a betrayal of fellow Americans.

Americans overwhelmingly want to help DREAMers. My GOP colleagues should reject White House divisiveness &amp; join Democrats to pass DREAM Act.
We must end the cruel chaos that Trump’s #DACA decision has sown - and act now to keep our promise to DREAMers.
Trump admin’s list of immigration demands is a slap in the face to DREAMers and an affront to the values that make America great.
We need better coordination – and robust long-term plan – to ensure Puerto Rico gets back on its feet and can rebuild stronger than before.
"If essentials delivery is failing, investigation should be federal, not just local, by FEMA Inspector General &amp; DOJ prosecutors if needed."
My constituents are right to ask: Why aren't loved ones in Puerto Rico getting the supplies they need? How long must they wait?
"In third week of humanitarian crisis, essential supply shortages continue to put American lives at risk. Unacceptable and unconscionable."
Delivery disconnect seems seriously widespread - as I heard in #Hartford today from families who have just arrived from Puerto Rico.

"AG Sessions shamefully prejudges courts in declaring #DACA illegal. Wrong on the law, wrong to duck his DOJ duty."
Sadly self-destructive #DACA decision is an economic nightmare for employers and job creators who depend on DREAMers’ skills and dedication.
"Trump #DACA decision already causing chaos, confusion, and cascading fear - threatening mass deportation on scale never seen before."
Trump’s sad and outrageous #DACA action should prompt even stronger bipartisan support for DREAM Act – more urgent and necessary than ever.
No such thing as “orderly wind-down” of #DACA. This despicable decision upends families &amp; derails hundreds of thousands of DREAMers' lives.
Nearly 1 million young immigrants came out of shadows on promise America would let them stay. #DACA decision betrays them and our values.
Eliminating #DACA would be the height of hypocrisy and inhumanity. Deliberately cruel and demagogic.
"To preserve American values and promises, l pledge to fight for the DREAM Act - a bipartisan act of simple humanity and common sense."
Mr. President: There's still time to show America keeps its word. Keep #DACA and the DREAMers.

"I am relieved today, but make no mistake - this is not the end of the fight for #healthcare."
"Democrats are ready to work on commonsense, bipartisan improvements to healthcare if our colleagues across the aisle will join us."
Let this be the end of a misguided and misanthropic effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Tonight is a tribute to a few politically courageous Senators who put the people they represent first.
"Tonight’s vote is a testament to millions of Americans who never gave up-driving to town halls, calling Congress, &amp; posting on social media."
"Profiles in courage slow, maybe stop, assault on American #healthcare system. A proud and moving moment."
Lives are at stake – in Connecticut and all across America. I will fight for each one with everything I’ve got.

I will fight this dangerous &amp; despicable plot to repeal the #ACA as if lives depend on it - because they do.
This sanctions bill sends a strong signal: America will not stand for rogue regimes’ attempts to disrupt international order &amp; security.
"Overwhelming passage of sanctions bill is a testament to indisputable desire to hold Russian, Iranian, &amp; North Korean regimes accountable."
President Trump must sign sanctions bill immediately to show he has the conviction and courage to stand up to our adversaries.
"With #healthcare vote looming, your pressure has never been more important. Thank you to all who have spoken out &amp; continue to do so."
"Let’s be clear: ""skinny repeal"" is a skeletal sham. Senate passage means @HouseGOP could pack it with far-right priorities."
"Do Republicans think stripping coverage from millions &amp; hiking premiums ""improves"" #healthcare? Maybe CBO should have included a dictionary."
"Skinny repeal ➡ 16M lose coverage, premiums up 20%. There are real people behind those numbers and they deserve better than this disgrace."
"Don't let the name fool you. ""Skinny repeal"" would destroy #healthcare for millions of Americans and decimate insurance markets."
"Under skinny repeal, 16M would lose coverage and premiums rise 20%. If the GOP thinks that's a step in the right direction, they need a map."

Never thought I would see cameras &amp; live coverage banned from White House press room. This pattern of secrecy is antithetical to our values.
"And if there truly are no tapes, why imply they exist if not to intimidate Comey? Special prosecutor must consider in obstruction probe."
"It is preposterous for the Commander in Chief, with his access to world-class intelligence, to say he has ""no idea"" if Comey tapes exist."
My constituents know this bill would decimate access to the #healthcare they need. I vow to fight it tooth and nail.
"And while the opioid crisis rages in every corner of the country, this bill woefully underfunds drug treatment and recovery programs."
"Seniors will see skyrocketing #healthcare costs, if they can get any coverage at all under this heartless plan."
"And just like the House, Senate Republicans want to gut #Medicaid – throwing children and families who rely on it to the wolves."
"Let's not forget, 13 GOP men worked in secret to craft a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood and blocks women and men from critical care."
The Republicans’ #healthcare plan will literally cost American lives.
"Under this bill, countless #CT patients, and millions more across America, will lose access to vital #healthcare services and protections."
Senate GOP's nips and tucks to House #healthcare bill aren't nearly enough to reshape this plan into anything approaching responsible.

"Joining @AC360 in a few minutes to discuss today’s #Russia hearing, #SallyYates testimony, and what needs to happen next."
Naming a special prosecutor is vital to delivering the answers and accountability Americans deserve. Time to learn who knew what and when.
White House officials at highest level could be witnesses or even targets - stakes are too high for anything but a fully independent probe.
"But we do know this: Only an independent investigation, led by special prosecutor, can hold Russian meddlers &amp; Trump associates accountable."
"Yet despite several warnings to WH over Flynn’s vulnerability to Russian blackmail, weeks passed before his ouster. We still don't know why."

That's why independent special prosecutor is an absolute necessity – only way to learn truth about what #Flynn did &amp; who knew about it.
"#Flynn’s actions demand impartial investigation, but we can’t trust Trump admin to fairly investigate one of its own."
"#Flynn took money from Russian &amp; Turkish governments, apparently concealed payments, then acted as foreign agent."

Hopeful that Yates &amp; Clapper testimony on #Russia will underscore need for investigation led by independent special prosecutor.
73% who want independent Russia investigation is an easy figure for Trump to remember - inverse of his approval rating.
