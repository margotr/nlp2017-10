"Recently, @CFPB finalized payday lending rule, to rein in predatory payday loans that often keep working people trapped in a cycle of debt."
These payday lenders saddle borrowers with triple-digit interest rates &amp; cost Ohioans over $500 million/year in fees alone.
Why did Ohio try to cap these rates? Shady payday lenders have only their own interests at heart.
Ohio has the highest payday loan prices in the US - despite the fact that almost 2/3 of Ohioans voted to cap payday loan rates.

"@cbo We cannot let politicians in Washington, with taxpayer-funded healthcare, pull the rug out from under Ohio families and communities."
@cbo And #GrahamCassidy allows insurance companies to charge Ohioans age 50 and older more for their insurance.
"According @CBO, the House GOP plan - nearly identical to #GrahamCassidy - would cause premiums to go up an average of about 20% next year."
"And whether or not you're on Medicaid, you're looking at a premium increase next year if #GrahamCassidy becomes law."
As well as the 3 in 5 nursing home residents in Ohio who rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of their care.
"Also hurt: 71,000 veterans in Ohio who get their coverage through Medicaid, and 150,000 Ohioans getting opioid treatment."
"So who gets hurt by these Medicaid cuts?
To start: 973,000 children in Ohio who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance"
"It cuts a net $20 BILLION from Ohio. For every $1 OH spends on Medicaid on average, 63¬¢ comes from federal $ that #GrahamCassidy would cut."
