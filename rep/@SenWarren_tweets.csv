"Responsible nations stick to their agreements. Responsible Presidents put America's safety first. If this President won't, Congress must."
Secretary Mattis said it’s good for our national security to stay in the #Irandeal. Chairman Dunford said Iran was complying with the terms.
"The #Irandeal is keeping Iran’s nuclear program under tough limits &amp; inspections. So far, it’s working to keep Iran away from a nuke."
The President’s outrageous decision to decertify isolates the US from our allies &amp; increases the risk that Iran gets a nuclear bomb.
Congress should act to stop @realDonaldTrump from following through on his threat to burn our health insurance system to the ground.
GOP &amp; Dem governors have urged Congress to keep our promise to families &amp; hold down health insurance premiums. We should listen to them.

Our federal govt must commit to helping the people of Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. US citizens deserve that much from their govt.

"All along, @realDonaldTrump's response in Puerto Rico has been too little, too late. But he gives himself an ""A+."" Give me a break."
It is outrageous that @realDonaldTrump is making veiled threats to withdraw relief workers from US citizens in need. That's poor leadership.
Puerto Rico is still facing a humanitarian crisis. @realDonaldTrump seems more worried about blaming hurricane victims than helping them.

The Trump Administration has failed to get rid of ISDS - the corporate courts in NAFTA that give big businesses their own special rights.
"Despite promising to fix NAFTA's problems, @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Admin have failed to fight for workers through the first 3 rounds."
The fundamental problem with NAFTA is simple: the agreement doesn't work for American workers.
The American public deserve answers about what went wrong at @Equifax and what the company plans to do going forward.

Only in the GOP alternative upside down reality can you hate a bill so much that you’re going to vote for it.
"Here’s what you learn in “How to be a Senator 101”: If you support a bill, you vote yes. If you don’t, you vote no."
"Mark my words: If the GOP can’t get a deal in committee that destroys the ACA even more, “skinny repeal” will become the law of the land."
"If the @SenateGOP wanted a bill they could fix in committee, it could’ve been blank piece of paper. They CHOSE to intro this malicious bill."
And here’s the worst part: The @SenateGOP knows this bill is appalling. One senator called it “a disaster.” “The dumbest thing in history.”
CBO says this latest garbage bill will lead to 16 MILLION more uninsured. https://t.co/huOjkQsfha

I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory &amp; racist comments that have no place in our justice system.
I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://t.co/qbty7x0iLl
"On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination: https://t.co/mnACXekh8f"

"The Wall St bankers may be popping champagne, but Americans haven't forgotten the 2008 financial crisis – and they won't forget today."
And @realDonaldTrump issued an order that puts 2 @GoldmanSachs execs in charge of gutting the rules that protect you from financial fraud.

".@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St during his campaign – but as @POTUS, we're finding out whose side he's really on."
Tonight I urged my Senate colleagues to vote no on this morally bankrupt giveaway to @exxonmobil: https://t.co/1vcJ8b3w5u

It’s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.
Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
"Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law."
"Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation’s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order."
"Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump’s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her."

Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.
"If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic, he’d deny ever hitting the iceberg."
"You have to wonder, @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?"

"On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember what can happen when hatred &amp; fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need."
Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.
"The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, &amp; college students who sought safety from terrorists."
"We are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity."
.@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.
Let’s be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.

And Betsy DeVos is unwilling to commit to be a cop on the beat with for-profit colleges that break the law &amp; cheat students.
Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.
I will vote against Betsy DeVos’s nomination for @USedgov because it’s not in the best interests of America’s young people.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions today show an ugly indifference to immigrants &amp; a profound misunderstanding of the real dangers we face.

Tom Price has also championed proposals to privatize Medicare &amp; radically restructure Medicaid – weakening our nation’s health care.
Tom Price championed ACA repeal. He’s opposed improvements to women’s care. He’s cosponsored leg to discriminate against LGBT ppl.
The job of @HHSgov sec is to “enhance &amp; protect the health…of all Americans.” I’m not convinced Tom Price is willing or able to do that.

19 of my @SenateDems colleagues &amp; I sent a letter to Mylan for answers about the EpiPen price hike: https://t.co/Q3q1yTinBN
Mylan’s promise of a new generic EpiPen for half the price only further calls into question the excessive price of branded EpiPens.
"Mylan’s expanded patient assistance programs are an industry game to keep EpiPen costs high for insurance companies, the gov &amp; employers."
I have serious concerns about pharmaceutical giant Mylan’s significant price hikes for the life-saving EpiPen Auto-Injector.
.@ITTTech's free ride is finally over &amp; the message is clear: We won't stand by &amp; allow these shady schools to cheat students &amp; taxpayers.
"Today, @usedgov has finally said enough is enough, banning @ITTTech from enrolling any new students with federal dollars this fall."
"The SEC, @CFPB, &amp; @MassAGO are all suing @ITTTech for fraud &amp; they failed, again, to meet the low standards of their accrediting agency."
".@ITTTech – a massive, for-profit college – is currently under investigation by 20 state &amp; federal agencies for cheating students."

GOP says @MassAGO’s investigation is a war on 1st Amendment rights. But companies don’t have a right to defraud their investors &amp; consumers.
We haven't found another example – not one – of a House committee subpoenaing a STATE AG's investigation of potential STATE law violations.
"The @HouseGOP claims to be for states’ rights, but they don’t seem to know the Constitution gives STATES power to enforce STATE law."
Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 issued subpoenas to @MassAGO Healey &amp; @AGSchneiderman— a prime example of @HouseGOP abuse of power.
The GOP-led @HouseScience Committee is helping @exxonmobil deny the reality of climate change.
Today in the @NEJM I write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health: https://t.co/l6hBWp53Hk
Yesterday @MassAGO took an important step to stop the spread of lethal assault-style weapons. Read more here: https://t.co/ElPNcmPTf5
"Let me offer you a word of advice, @LamarSmithTX21 &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong AG."
This is an outrageous abuse of Congressional subpoena power to threaten a state AG and help a campaign contributor.
"For the @GOP, states’ rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating women’s bodies. Not investigating climate change fraud."
.@LamarSmithTX21 says he “takes very seriously his obligation to uphold &amp; defend the Constitution” — but apparently not the 10th Amendment.
"Yup, that’s right: House Republicans are interfering with a state AG’s ongoing investigation of a company violating state law."
Now @exxonmobil got the Chair of the @HouseScience Committee — a TX Republican who has taken $675k from oil &amp; gas — to subpoena @MassAGO.
First @exxonmobil tried to stop @MassAGO by suing Healey in a TX court &amp; attacking her integrity because she’s doing her job.
.@MassAGO Maura Healey is investigating whether @exxonmobil broke state laws by knowingly misleading people about climate change.
Want to see how giant corporations rig the system? Look at what @exxonmobil is doing to intimidate @MassAGO to stop fraud investigation.

"Trump U violated NY law by calling itself a ""university"" without a charter or license. Vulnerable people lost big bucks to Trump's scheme."
The @HouseGOP should be ashamed. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving homophobic Americans a license to discriminate.
"The GOP #FADA bill could let hospitals, government workers, employers, &amp; even landlords discriminate against married same-sex couples."
Marriage equality is the law of the land. But #LGBT Americans still lack federal protections against discrimination they desperately need.
I’m not joking: @HouseGOP are holding a hearing right now about making it easier for people to discriminate against #LGBT Americans.
Our country has seen too many tragedies this month. So what are the @HouseGOP doing right now? Holding a hearing to legalize hate.
"I wish I had the answers right now to stop the very real pain that people are feeling, but I know this: change must come. It must come now."
I'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart at exactly the moment when we need to come together.

"Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, &amp; police shouldn't be killed while protecting &amp; serving their communities."
"No. No. No. No. No. More killing solves nothing. More grieving moms &amp; dads, sons &amp; daughters cannot bring back those we’ve already  lost."
#blacklivesmatter must be more than a hashtag or trending topic every time a tragedy happens. We must all come together to make it true.
We can't ignore the ugly reality: black parents are terrified that teaching kids to “survive” the police won't be enough. #blacklivesmatter
Most cops are good ppl. But we can’t ignore the ugly reality: black parents feel they must teach kids to “survive” police. #blacklivesmatter

"I didn’t think the GOP could write 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, PP, AND clean water all at once – but they did it. #Zika"
The GOP #Zika bill cuts Senate levels of @DeptVetAffairs funding by $500M – money for VA hospital maintenance &amp; raises for doctors &amp; nurses.
The GOP #Zika bill rolls back Clean Water Act requirements designed to keep pesticides out of Americans’ drinking water.
The GOP #Zika bill blocks @PPFA from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with Zika avoid having deformed babies.
The GOP #Zika bill guts money from healthcare exchanges in the Affordable Care Act (#obamacare) to pay for the emergency response.

The GOP #Zika bill provides $800 million less in funding than the @WhiteHouse requested. Money we need for prevention &amp; treatment.
"Then while @HouseDemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #NoBillNoBreak, the @HouseGOP jammed through a terrible #Zika bill at 3am."

"Now we have a real, genuine health crisis in America — the #Zika virus — and the @SenateGOP have done nothing but get ready for vacation."

Read my letter to Chair Mary Jo White about my serious concerns with the SEC: https://t.co/8CHbzCAIpH
This decision is a mockery of the SEC's core mission &amp; the latest example of the SEC failing to punish guilty parties &amp; protect investors.
"Just 2 months after Cohen's sanction, the SEC approved the application of a new investment firm co-owned by… Steven Cohen. Seriously."
"SAC Capital pled guilty to insider trading in 2013. In Jan, the SEC barred its manager Steven Cohen from managing outside funds until 2018."
Wall St broke our economy — not Central States Pension Fund workers. @USTreasury should reject their pension cuts. https://t.co/G5vMtGGfe2
"In 2008, Wall Street got a bailout. What did those truck drivers, dockworkers &amp; warehouse workers get? They got stuck with bill."
"Goldman Sachs &amp; Northern Trust got $41M to manage workers’ pension funds, &amp; they recklessly gambled it on junk bonds &amp; toxic mortgages."

That’s the definition of “unbelievable” in the real world – but it’s business as usual in the cozy world of Wall Street.
"“Unbelievable”? Yes, totally unbelievable that JPM could get tagged as TBTF &amp; then pat each other on the backs &amp; say “heckuva job.”"

"Today, our top regulators warned us about the danger of the biggest banks. We would be foolish to ignore their warnings."
This is a giant warning sign of the central role big banks will play in the next crisis unless Congress &amp; regulators show some backbone.
"No execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. None went to jail. Some, like Jamie Dimon, are still running the same banks."
"Big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up, the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts."
The big banks spread risk throughout the system by misleading investors about the quality of mortgages in the securities they were offering.
There would be no crisis without these giant banks that encouraged reckless mortgage lending &amp; funded slimy subprime lenders.
Wall St lobbyists have tried to deflect blame for the 2008 crisis for years. But their revisionist history is untrue &amp; dangerous.
"Unless the banks promptly address regulators’ concerns, the gov must push these banks to get smaller &amp; less complex."
5 US banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; weren’t bailed out. It’s a very big deal. It’s scary.
"Today, after an extensive review, fed regulators concluded that 5 of the biggest banks are still Too Big to Fail. https://t.co/zZNeA8HjrN"
The Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill to push the IRS to simplify Tax Day. Learn more: https://t.co/knv4GUBu8G
And the Tax Filing Simplification Act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.
The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.
It prohibits the IRS from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.
"My bill directs the IRS to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov."
Today I introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.
"Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry."
"This year, taxpayers will spend an average of 13 hrs prepping taxes &amp; pay $200 for tax prep services."
Read my office’s new report on how the IRS caved to powerful companies w/ a vested interest in complicated taxes: https://t.co/wXXrLh60T7
That means taxpayers have to spend billions – and share personal info with 3rd-parties – just to file taxes.
The tax prep industry has fought zealously to block the IRS from implementing laws to make tax prep &amp; filing easier.
