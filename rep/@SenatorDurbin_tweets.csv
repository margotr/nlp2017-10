The banks’ own study shows small businesses are satisfied with debit fees under the swipe reform law. Repeal would raise those fees.
Big banks are already making record profits. No need to let them rig the debit swipe fee system again
"Repealing swipe fee reform would be a gut punch to Main Street restaurants, retailers, &amp; gas stations. It would raise prices &amp; cost jobs"
"Now the big banks &amp; their friends in Congress want to repeal this reform, doubling the average debit swipe fee"
"Even though banks fought this reform every step of the way, it has boosted competition &amp; reduced debit fees"
"In 2010, Congress passed swipe fee reform to rein in Visa &amp; MasterCard’s debit fee-fixing on behalf of big banks"
That’s a rigged system. It avoids competition and makes merchants/ consumers pay banks billions in excessive fees
For years I’ve heard big banks argue to let Visa &amp; MasterCard fix swipe fee rates on their behalf

I will vote no when Gorsuch comes before the Judiciary Cmte. I will vote no on cloture. I will oppose his nomination on the Senate floor.
"With the legal and constitutional issues haunting this White House, the Senate cannot rubber stamp a lifetime appointment for this President"
"60 votes is a threshold that #SCOTUS nominees have met for the past ¼ century. If Gorsuch falls short, then Trump should pick a new nominee."
Majority Leader McConnell has made clear time and time again that 60 votes is the standard for matters of controversy in the Senate.
No one should be surprised that Judge Gorsuch will need to meet the threshold of 60 Senate votes in order to be confirmed.
I came away from his hearing firmly convinced that I must oppose the nomination of Judge Gorsuch.
Judge Gorsuch was given a full and fair hearing. He was given every opportunity to explain his judicial record and his views.
He needed to show that he'd be an independent check on President Trump and rule against the right-wing groups that picked him if required
Judge Gorsuch needed to be straight with the American people about his record and his views—avoiding critical questions was unacceptable
"Judge Gorsuch needed to demonstrate that he would uphold and defend the Constitution for ALL of us, not just the privileged few"
