Republicans are hiding their bill because they know it‚Äôs a bad deal for the American people and Michigan families.
"And if you‚Äôre a senior whose rates are going to skyrocket, you have a right to know what‚Äôs in the bill."
"If you‚Äôre a woman who will be charged more for insurance, you have a right to know what‚Äôs in the bill."
