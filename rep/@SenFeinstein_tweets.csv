We agree that civilians shouldn't have machine guns. We should agree on banning accessories that allow weapons to fire like machine guns.

"38 senators support our bill to ban bump stocks. We're making progress, but we need your help. Urge Republican senators to support S.1916!"
Semi-automatic rifles fire between 45 and 60 rounds/minute. A bump stock increases the rate of fire to between 400 and 800 rounds/minute.
Bump fire stocks allow semi-automatic weapons to reach rates of fire of between 400 and 800 rounds PER MINUTE.
Las Vegas shooter outfitted 12 semi-automatic weapons w/ bump stocks. No law on the books would have stopped him from buying bump stocks.
FACT: Legislation is needed to ban bump stocks. This CAN’T be done through regulation.
Automatic weapons have been banned since 1986. Banning accessories that allow weapons to reach an automatic rate of fire is a no-brainer.
Technology like bump stocks has made the current definition of automatic weapons largely obsolete. That’s why we MUST update our laws.

"The Graham-Cassidy ""health care"" bill hits states that expanded Medicaid especially hard. That means California. We MUST defeat this bill!"
A top priority between now and September 30 must be defeating the Graham-Cassidy bill. #SaveACA
The latest ‘health care’ bill—Graham-Cassidy—is much like the four that came before it: 32 million would lose coverage.
Here’s what you need to know about the Graham-Cassidy bill: It would disproportionately hurt California and take away billions.
Republicans have until September 30th to pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We can’t lose focus. #SaveACA
ATTENTION: Senate Republicans may try to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid AGAIN. Time to make calls!

UPDATE: It’s 10 p.m. and we haven’t seen the bill we’re supposed to vote on TONIGHT.
The reason to vote “YES” is to get a bill signed into law. The reason to vote “NO” is to kill it. Simple!
Health care is a matter of life and death. For Senate Republicans to proceed so cavalierly betrays our obligation to the American people.
"If you’re not willing to see a bill get signed into law, DON’T VOTE FOR IT! #SkinnyRepeal"
Republicans claim they want to lower premiums. Their latest plan INCREASES premiums by 20 percent more than projected. #SkinnyRepeal
"24 million, 22 million, 32 million, 16 million—that’s how many Americans lose coverage under the first four Republican health care bills."
Why would a conference committee produce a good health care bill when every bill produced so far has been an unmitigated disaster? Vote NO!
Senate Republicans are now saying they will vote for a bill ONLY if House Republicans promise NOT to vote for it. Absurd!

"A few weeks ago at @UCSFChildrens in San Francisco I met with three mothers—Kristin, Sally and Nina. https://t.co/jQOGkxTZrG"
Medicaid helps individuals with disabilities lead full lives. Protecting it is about defending the rights of all disabled people.
SOON: Democrats will offer an amendment to protect those with disabilities and send the bill to committee so we can have an OPEN process.

NEW: Republicans are pushing a plan that would destroy the individual insurance market nationwide. This is another easy NO vote!
"Democrats will offer an amendment to protect Medicaid and send the bill to committee so we can proceed with an OPEN, bipartisan process."
This approach would cause 32 MILLION Americans to lose coverage. Premiums next year would increase by 25% MORE than projected!
NEXT: We vote on the 2nd Republican amendment in an hour. It repeals the Affordable Care Act with no replacement. An easy NO vote.
It’s good news that this amendment was soundly defeated. It shows there is little support for the bill Republicans have pushed for months.
"Under this plan, 22 million Americans would lose coverage and Medicaid would be cut by 35%, devastating care for children and the elderly."
"Let’s recap: The 1st Republican amendment, which slashes Medicaid, increases premiums and brings back junk plans was DEFEATED 43-57."

The process on health care in the coming days will be confusing. That’s by design. Republicans don’t want you to know what they’re doing!
"To my colleagues who are undecided, make no mistake, the final vote on health care will be among the most important you will ever take."
Senate Republicans are moving forward on repealing the Affordable Care Act with no idea what's next. It's the height of irresponsibility.
This is a gut-check moment. Senators need to decide whether taking health coverage away from millions is what they were sent here to do.

Care for children with the most serious health care needs will be put at risk if we slash Medicaid. The Republican bill must be defeated.
I don’t understand how anyone could vote to advance a bill that takes health care away from millions without hearing from those affected.
"At @UCSFChildrens, I met families with employer-sponsored health coverage who rely on Medicaid to fill in gaps. It’s vital for so many."
Each version of the Republican health care bill goes beyond repealing Affordable Care Act—ending Medicaid as we know it.
FACT: Republican health bill would increase premiums for older Americans. Junk plans that don’t cover needed care are NOT “freedom.”
"Make no mistake, a 'yes' vote on health care is an endorsement of the most indefensible process on a major bill I’ve seen in 24 years."
Gutting Medicaid threatens children’s hospitals nationwide—endangering the lives of our most vulnerable children. Terrible!

(3/4) We can’t afford to reverse course. Let’s maintain momentum and act on policies that make the U.S. economy work for everyone.
"(2/4) Wages for hourly workers have increased 2.8 percent, much faster than the pace of inflation."
"(1/4) So far, 2016 data has shown positive job growth, increased hourly earnings and the same type of increased household income."
(2/2) The facts are clear: Our nation’s economy is getting stronger. https://t.co/r981WN5DJF
(1/2) Growth had never exceeded 5 percent since the Census began tracking data in 1967.
"Our bill would make #WildlifeTrafficking punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine using the money laundering statute."

The bottom line is #SCOTUS can’t do its job with just eight members. The Senate needs to do its job and confirm Judge Garland. #DoYourJob
#SCOTUS is also taking fewer cases to avoid deadlocks. Data from @SCOTUSBLOG shows the Court has taken fewer cases than it normally does.
"Even in cases where #SCOTUS has not tied, cases are resolved in a way that does not decide the main issue—same effect as a tie. #DoYourJob"
"There were ties in #SCOTUS cases involving union dues, banking practices, election law, the death penalty and immigration—a range of issues."
There have been seven tie #SCOTUS votes since Justice Scalia passed away in February. Many of these cases were major. #DoYourJob
"I’m concerned about the effects of an eight-member Court: tie votes, decisions that don’t resolve the key issue and fewer cases being heard."
"#SCOTUS is the final arbiter of legal disputes in this country. If it's not functioning, our justice system suffers. #DoYourJob"
The Senate in 2005 did its job to confirm the #SCOTUS nominee. The Senate in 2016 also needs to do its job. #DoYourJob
"The full Senate confirmed Roberts on September 29. When #SCOTUS returned to session in October 2005, it had a full set of nine justices."
"After a full week of hearings, Roberts’ nomination was reported to the full Senate on September 22. #DoYourJob"
Let me recount what happened: Roberts’ confirmation hearings began 11 years ago this week. I remember them well. #DoYourJob
"The last time #SCOTUS was at risk for beginning its term without a full bench, the Senate quickly confirmed a nominee—Justice John Roberts."
"#SCOTUS returns in October. Because the Senate refuses to do its job, the Court will start its term without nine justices. #DoYourJob"
"Judge Garland is now the longest-pending #SCOTUS nominee in history, having waited 57 days longer than Louis Brandeis in 1916. #DoYourJob"
"As of today, Judge Merrick Garland, @SCOTUSNom, has been waiting an unprecedented 182 days for Senate confirmation. #DoYourJob"
No woman should live in fear of abuse. The Violence Against Women Act was signed into law 22 years ago today to achieve that goal. #VAWA
