"#TrumpCare won't improve the quality of care for Americans or lower costs. ACA already works for millions. Let's improve it, not break it!"
Using #ACA anniversary as an arbitrary deadline to rush through #TrumpCare for symbolic reasons is ridiculous. GOP must take this seriously
#TrumpCare ends the #ACA #Medicaid expansion &amp; dismantles the program as we know it. Bad for millions of Americans who depend on #Medicaid
#TrumpCare would double the number of uninsured people under the age of 65
"The #ACA has insured over 20 million Americans in 7 years, while #TrumpCare stands to leave 24 million fewer people with health care"
"It's the 7th anniversary of the #AffordableCareAct today, and we must protect this law that's helped millions of Americans"

"#TrumpCare would result in an approximate $3,200 monthly premium increase for the average 64 year old"

This weekend marked a year of war vs ISIL still w/out Congressional approval. Read yesterday's piece in @PilotOpinion http://t.co/rhLLeOYUax
Congress has refused to debate or vote on the war vs ISIL for 1 yr. My oped on this anniversary in @washingtonpost:  https://t.co/zKT5ypPljD
I believe there is a bipartisan path forward on a new #AUMF in Congress. Read my resolution with @JeffFlake: http://t.co/R9n4wp8T81
"One year into the U.S. mission against ISIL, our servicemembers are doing their jobs but they're still waiting on Congress to do ours #AUMF"
"For 1yr, troops - many from VA - have risked their lives fighting ISIL. Congress owes them a debate &amp; vote on the war http://t.co/6xmomWTBT4"

"One year of unauthorized war vs ISIL: 4,462 airstrikes. 3,000 troops serving. $9.4M spent per day. A new #AUMF is needed as conflict expands"
Contrast between Congress' indifference to war vs ISIL and its energetic challenge to diplomacy in #IranDeal is baffling

The #IranDeal is not about making an ally out of an adversary. It is about denying an adversary a path to obtaining nuclear weapons
The #IranDeal takes a nuclear weapons program that was progressing forward and disables it for many years through peaceful diplomatic means
"On the #IranDeal, America has shown that patient diplomacy can achieve what isolation &amp; hostility cannot. For this reason, I will support it"
