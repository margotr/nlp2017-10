"Since @Equifax breach of 143 million Americans' info, I've received nearly 4 dozen letters from Nevadans seeking justice."
"With at least 54,000 @WellsFargo fake accounts created in Nevada, it's more important than ever that consumers have protections from @CFPB."
"When we let Nevadans have their day in court, it puts another cop on the beat to ensure Big Banks can’t gouge borrowers w/ tricks &amp; traps."
"Whether it's fake accounts from @WellsFargo or @Equifax data breach, consumers need access to justice system &amp; have their day in court."
"The @CFPB issued a simple, straightforward rule that safeguards the right of every single American consumer to hold Big Banks accountable."
"In its short life, the @CFPB has returned $12 billion to 29 million consumers. In NV, the CFPB has worked to resolve about 14,600 cases."
"As NV's AG, I took on the Big Banks that preyed upon NV families, bringing back $1.9 billion to NV. Now, @CFPB looks out for consumers."
Fraud shouldn't be kept secret like in @WellsFargo scandal - American people need @CFPB rule so companies don't take advantage of consumers.
.@CFPB’s rule banning forced arbitration guarantees consumers their day in court to hold the worst companies accountable.

Cuts to #Medicaid will have a severe impact on Latinas. 17m Latinas now have access to free preventative care. #ACA repeal would undo this.

"We need an Education Secretary who will fight for the success of our public schools, not one whose life’s mission has been to undermine them"

DeVos is wildly out of her depth on major policy areas that would be under her jurisdiction if confirmed. Our students deserve better.
