"I urge the Senate to support that provision &amp; bill so that we can avoid devastating impacts on the Alaskan economy, and across the country."
"As a Senator for AK &amp; Chairman of Interior Approps, I included a provision in FY16 funding bill that prohibits EPA from implementing WOTUS."
"The bottom line is that the new WOTUS rule will have absurd results in Alaska, in particular, in addition to steep financial costs."
"There aren‚Äôt many places in AK more than 4000 feet away from some kind of water: rivers, lakes, wetlands. Even permafrost might be regulated"
I thank the EPW Committee for recently passing bipartisan legislation that I co-sponsored to require the agencies to develop a better rule.
The costs we face when developing in Alaska are already steep enough. They will be magnified and worsened by the final WOTUS rule.
"Impacts the man who wants to build a cabin on the Chena Ridge, the small miner in the Goldstream Valley, the subdivision developer in N Pole"
"Under WOTUS if you have a 500 acres of land, &amp; 10 sq ft are within 4000 ft of any jurisdictional water, the entire plot can now be regulated"
174 mil acres in AK are wetlands (the entire state of TX is 172 mil acres). 43% of AK is considered wetlands compared to 5% in the Lower 48
WOTUS is far beyond a simple clarification-it increases EPA‚Äôs regulatory reach &amp; subjects new projects to impossible permitting requirements
"EPA *claims* WOTUS rule is a clarification to provide ‚Äúcertainty‚Äù and ‚Äúpredictability,* but in Alaska it does the opposite."

"Intl. trade supports 90,000 AK jobs, ~70% are part of our small/medium sized-businesses, from fishermen to natural resource developers."
"When Alaskans discuss economic partners, being separated from the Lower 48, more often than not we talk about exports with partners abroad."
"Many Alaskans have reached out to me about the Trade Promotion Authority that I just voted to advance, and I wanted to share my reasoning."

(2/2) This bill directs the Dept. of Interior to work with local stakeholders in AK to work towards these Arctic goals.
"(1/2) As Chair of @ArcticCouncil, US is in a position to meet Arctic objectives: security, natural resources, Native communities, research."
"Interior FY16 funding bill increases onshore &amp; offshore #energy development, prevents extras regs on #fracking, cuts extra fees on drilling."

Accurate maps are necessary for navigation &amp; development in AK--this bill provides $1.3M for 3D mapping &amp; $3.2M for geologic mapping.
"Located on the Ring of Fire, AK relies on the @alaska_avo for safety. $1M is included for maintenance of volcano monitoring stations."
"(2/2) DOI is now required, after identifying contaminated Alaska Native lands in need of remediation, to expedite the clean-up process."
(1/2) In 1998 Dept. of  Interior submitted a report to Congress acknowledging that it conveyed approx. 650 contaminated sites through ANCSA.
Good news for Southeast--this bill requires timber sales in AK be economic &amp; the USFS use an appraisal system suited for AK's unique needs.
Tribal courts in AK are vital for rural justice--this bill funds $10M for pilot programs to improve law enforcement/criminal justice process
"(2/2) This bill also separates the funds for CSCs from resources for other programs, to avoid CSC money being spent on other agencies."
(1/2) Huge news--Alaska‚Äôs Native healthcare providers will have fully-funded contract support costs for the 2nd year in a row.
"The USFWS conducted a $71,000 hunt to kill 'invasive caribou' on Kagalaska--this bill prohibits funds for such costly hunts in the future."

"(2/3) From fixing the Dalton Hwy to building homes in Fbks, projects in AK will face impossible permitting requirements because of #WOTUS."
"(1/3) The EPA's #WOTUS rule is a showstopper for any type of development in AK, and is the largest of the EPA's many land grabs."
