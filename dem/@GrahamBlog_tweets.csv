I fear a government shutdown will harm our ability to achieve our ultimate objective of defunding Planned Parenthood.
"From past experiences, I know the media &amp; many Americans will reflexively blame the GOP should a government shutdown occur."
"We do NOT currently have 290 members of the House of Representatives, along with 67 Senators, who will vote to override a presidential veto."
President Obama is downright hostile to the cause of protecting life. #prolife
Instead we should set our sights on winning the war &amp; that only comes about by electing a President &amp; Congress committed to protecting life.
"We will fight to defund Planned Parenthood, but we do not have the votes to win the battle right now."
I wholly support Defunding of Planned Parenthood (PP). I would never send a budget to Capitol Hill that contains 1 penny of funding for PP.
