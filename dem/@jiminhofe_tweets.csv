U.S. Conference of Mayors reports that each public dollar invested in water infrastructure increases private long-term GDP output by $6.35
Investment in infrastructure expands our economy. Plain and simple.
We have to make sure fed mandates don’t force communities to spend millions of $ on projects that may have little impact on water quality
We need increase support for small rural communities who simply can’t afford the investments that @EPA wants them to make. @EPWMaj
We need to look for ways to encourage even more private investment in water and wastewater infrastructure. @EPWMaj
"In our proposal to help #Flint and other communities around the country, we are planning to provide $70 million to capitalize WIFIA. @EPWMaj"
".@EPA is finally requesting funding to start up the WIFIA program, although they are only requesting $15M"
We have to find new ways to increase investment in infrastructure – In ’14 we took action by adding the WIFIA to the @EPWMaj #WRDA bill
The President’s FY 2017 budget proposed cutting the clean water fund by $414M. @EPWMaj
We must support the clean water &amp; drinking water state revolving loan funds that provide low cost loans for infrastructure improvements
When we force communities to chase mandates we risk losing basic public health protections and the economic foundation of our communities
"Federal mandates force local communities to change their priorities, pushing basic repair and replacement to the bottom of the list. @EPWMaj"
"Taxpayers aren’t just paying for services, we’re paying for unfunded federal mandates – bills are becoming unaffordable to many Americans"

"It is time for a White House that will rebuild our military, protect our borders &amp; execute a clearly-stated strategy w/ allies against ISIL"
The president's policies are weakening our nation’s security at a time when we face the most dangerous world in modern day history.
"He also is working to close the GTMO, releasing most of these terrorists to countries around the world &amp; bringing the remaining to US prison"
"Instead, he has downplayed Benghazi, called ISIL a JV team and said ISIL was ‘contained’ hours before the attacks on Paris."
Terrorism is what the president should have been discussing with the global community during his visit to Paris this past December.
And instead recognize and stand up to the reality of the serious threat of radical Islam.
I urge the president to set aside his rhetoric that global warming is the biggest threat we currently face.
The US must also continue to work together with Europe and all our allies to preserve democracy and protect our freedom-loving citizens.
U.S. must continue to reassess &amp; tighten our own security measures and vetting process of individuals looking to enter the country.

In OK we have  unused water in 12 lakes I want to ensure that this unused water can be repurposed for use in my state #WRDA @EPWMaj
We want to work with the Corps to optimize use of this water while meeting existing project purposes/ honoring existing water rights #WRDA
The Corps manages ~9.8M acre feet of water and #WRDA14 requires reports on management of these resources –  we’ve yet to see a report
"I also want to encourage public-private partnerships to produce new benefits, like expanding water supplies or energy production #WRDA"
"I want to make sure the Corps has authority to accept $ and services from non-federal sponsors on a voluntary, non-reimbursable basis #WRDA"
