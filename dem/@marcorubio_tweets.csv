Here is the part where the Dolphin fan in me hopes he announces he is retiring
But it is a TD. Game. Instant classic. Wow
That will be reviewed.
Unreal. Ball at the 1
"When someone can place a throw in these tight windows like Brady is now doing, nothing a defense can do"
It has been a tough year for @NFL but you could not ask for a better #Super Bowl to close it out.
Bad knee injury. Hyperextended. Tough to see
No reason not to sell out on the block here
Tough spot for Matt Ryan. They should really let clock run here. Turnover here or blocked punt and you give them shot at a 3
"Atlanta, you now know what this Brady guy has done to me and my Dolphins for 15 years."
This game has completely turned since the Gaga show.
This new KFC Colonel in commercials is freaky scary.
If Patriots win this game you will see that catch for years to come. Inches off ground.
That is the helmet catch of this #super bowl
Falcons are mauling this receivers. They aren't going to call holding on every play
"Just over 3 minutes, and perhaps the best QB in NFL history is a touchdown and a 2 away from incredible comeback"
Atlanta need to play to punt here try to pin inside 10
There are maybe two people in league today who can make that catch
This could be a career defining drive for Matt Ryan
The 8 points from pick six and missed extra point is now the difference in the game.
"And the quick score, less than 2 minutes on the drive"
And there is the turnover
If Falcons get 1st down here with 9 minutes left Patriots have at most two full possessions left unless they get a turnover or quick score
Worse thing about #SuperBowl blowouts? Everyone leaves early &amp; you become sole member of the cleanup crew.
"Knew Falcons could score but had no idea their defense this fast &amp; disruptive.don't watch NFC much AFC,did they play D like this all year?"
That was a sack of Brady with evil intentions
When it rains.......
Need to look for Bennett here
cant run and dropping passes very UN-patriot like Credit to Atlanta D Playing aggressive man &amp; willing to take a few holding calls downfield
Because Dolphins have played him twice a year for 15 years I have seen this movie before. Brady is very good in these situations.
Very big 3rd down
opening drive of 2nd half of this #SuperBowl is big. If @AtlantaFalcons put up another 7 will be quite a statement &amp; may be fatal dagger
Wasn't sure what to expect with everything going on. But that was quite a show by @ladyGaga one of best #SuperBowl  shows I can remember
When you are down 18 the longer than usual halftime of a #SuperBowl is a bit of a break.A little longer to make adjustments &amp; break momentum
This is where they miss Gronk. Inside the 20
Wow! Pick Six.
"No quarterback, not even the great Tom Brady is going to do well with being roughed up on virtually every pass play."
I hadn't seen many @AtlantaFalcons all year. The speed of their defense at the second and third level is impressive.
Liberty City own @devontafreeman makes his mark on first play from scrimmage
President George H.W. Bush such a honorable and decent man. Wonderful moment at #SuperBowl
