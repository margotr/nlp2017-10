My full statement on State Dept‚Äôs admission today that $400M cash payment to #Iran was a ransom: https://t.co/9AqBWzIEx3
"POTUS owes American people, particularly families of those killed in Iranian-backed attacks, answers. We'll keep fighting until we get them"
#Iran is world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. This ransom payment gives regime resources &amp; incentive to target more Americans.
State Dept's admission proves what we said from start: Obama admin paid ransom to terrorist regime that's backed attacks against US &amp; allies
Obama admin misled Congress when it repeatedly denied any connection btw release of US hostages &amp; $1.7B payout to #Iran

We should all reflect on how we can find a better path forward that honors and upholds our values as a nation.
"Violence and hate will not bring justice, they will only bring more tragedy and heartache to our communities."
"We, as a nation, join families of our fallen heroes in grieving. Our thoughts are with them and with those wounded in this horrible attack."
Our nation's police officers run toward danger every day to keep us safe. Today is another day of far too many when they didn't make it home

Urge Senate Dems to reconsider their opposition to MilCon/VA &amp; honor commitments we've made to our military heroes &amp; their families.
"MilCon/VA bill Dems blocked also funds key #MO priorities, including new #NGA West HQ in #STL &amp; fire station at @fortleonardwood"
"MilCon/VA includes funding for #VA programs to improve access to care, enhance military housing, aid homeless vets &amp; more"
The MilCon/VA bill Senate Dems voted against today provides record funding for America's #veterans: https://t.co/0VeHLENhlW
Our nation's #veterans have sacrificed too much to have their #healthcare &amp; benefits blocked by Democrats' political posturing.
"#Zika threat is a public health emergency, not a political opportunity. https://t.co/LZydGyTmUl #FightZikaNow #ZikaVirus"
"Senate voted to give $1.1B in emergency #Zika funding 1+ mo ago. Senate Dems supported that level of funding then, yet blocked it today."
Senate Dems' vote to block emergency #Zika funding is nothing short of shameful. https://t.co/LZydGyBM2N #FightZikaNow #ZikaVirus
In case you missed it: my call to Senate Dems to pass critical funding to combat #Zika &amp; support our #veterans: https://t.co/Yt9PQxlhO3
"RT @SenateGOP: Democrats were for $1.1 billion in #Zika funding before they were against it. Tell @SenateDems to #FightZikaNow.
https://t.c‚Ä¶"
The #ZikaVirus is a real public health emergency - not an opportunity to score political points. #FightZikaNow https://t.co/p7N2nbCt8l
"If Dems fail to meet their obligation to keep Americans safe &amp; honor our #veterans, they'll have to explain that to the American people."
"Milcon/VA also provides resources to keep our country safe, including funding for new #NGA west HQ in St. Louis: https://t.co/Yt9PQxlhO3"
"Milcon/VA bill provides necessary funding for #VA prgorams to improve access to care, support add'tl health services &amp; assist homeless #vets"
Bipartisan agreement includes same level of funding supported by every Democrat when it passed the Senate: https://t.co/Yt9PQxCTcD
"Zika epidemic is public health emergency, yet Senate Dems are playing politics w/bipartisan agreement that provides resources to fight virus"
It‚Äôs unconscionable that Senate Dems are threatening to block a bipartisan agreement that funds #Zika efforts &amp; increases vets' resources.
Restoring yr-round #PellGrants helps students stay enrolled in college &amp; graduate faster &amp; gives non-traditional students more flexibility.

POTUS said today that he knows who the enemy is. What the American people need to know is what he is doing to stop them.
"In the wake of a brutal attack that took 49 innocent Americans' lives, POTUS' comments were more focused on defending his record than the US"
POTUS' remarks today did nothing to change fact that he hasn't put forth a comprehensive plan to defeat terrorist threat &amp; protect Americans
