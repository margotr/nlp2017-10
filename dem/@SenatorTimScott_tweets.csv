20. I’m also not going to stop looking for a solution – giving up isn’t what we were sent here to do.
19. I’m not going to give up on repealing the Unaffordable Care Act. American families deserve better.
"18. I truly believe we all want what’s best for our nation and her people. To me, that’s finding a better solution than the ACA provides."
17. But here’s what I’m not doing – I’m not going to impugn the intentions of people who disagree
16. You can’t just put your head in the sand and ignore those facts and hope that it lives forever
"15. Its price tag grew and grew from the billions into the trillions, and finally scoring agencies just gave up"
"14. The ACA is not sustainable, and hasn’t been from the beginning. Its foundation was built on certain groups that never signed up"
13. I remain committed to repealing the ACA and replacing it with a system that works for all families
"12. So that’s where we stand today. A bad program that has grown deep roots, and a bitterly divided political culture."
"11. We’ve got to realize that our pattern should not be disagree and destroy, but rather disagree and solve"
"10. And two – along the way we stopped fighting the policy, and started fighting the people behind it"
9. No matter how badly the program serves (or doesn’t serve) the people – replacing an entitlement is hard
"8. The ACA went into effect, and – “A government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth” (Reagan)"
7. Two things happened along the way to where we stand today
6. These are facts – you can’t argue with them. And that’s not how our health care system should work
"5. Not everyone got to keep their doctors, and they weren’t able to keep their plans"
"4. Millions are paying for insurance they don’t want. In SC, more than 100,000 stuck without an option"
"3. In South Carolina, we’re down to one insurer offering plans on the exchanges.We’re seeing triple digit premium hikes,sky high deductibles"
"2. The debt continues to grow, and the ACA is not getting any better. The former isn’t helped by the latter."

"It is a life long passion for me, and I am committed to working for ALL of our kids."
I want true reform that strengthens public education and gives parents a choice for their childrens’ future.
"So while some want to continue to put band-aids on a system that isn’t working for a lot of kids, I do not."
"Because without education, incarceration rates go up, unemployment goes up, lifetime earnings go down."
"We will work with Secretary DeVos to strengthen all of our schools, and to make sure quality education is available to all."
Let’s be clear-there are 1000s of low performing schools across this nation. You can hold the floor forever…but it won’t change that fact
The fact remains no Secretary of Education has the power to “destroy public schools” - and no one would.
"We need strong public schools, as well as strong options for parents to choose the best option for their kids."
"I am thankful for all the calls, for the passion we’ve seen about education policy for the past two weeks."

"6. There is amazing work being done in communities across our nation every day, but their efforts aren’t always recognized by policymakers."
"5. We’re engaging communities, learning about solutions from the ground up instead of trying force them from the top down."
4. We’ve brought together the #SenateOpportunityCoalition to help change that.
"3. We have created a poverty floor, but not the opportunities needed for every family in every community to find success."
"2. The solutions of the past 50 years, while well intentioned, simply have not gotten that job done."

"@elizmSC simply not true. Cornyn amendment blocks terrorists from buying weapons, protects due process."
@TriciaSheldon @LindseyGrahamSC @girlsreallyrule no-fly/terror lists aren't mistake proof. Can't ignore due process.
@michaelaadele Can't just ignore due process. Innocent people mistakenly put on lists. Cornyn solves both issues.
@TriciaSheldon @LindseyGrahamSC @girlsreallyrule Cornyn amendment blocks terrorists buying weapons and protects due process. Voted for it.
@vickiringer @LindseyGrahamSC simply not true. Cornyn amendment blocks terrorists from buying guns AND protects due process.
Says the guy following me on Twitter... https://t.co/ZV7PzNWuKR
@HamptonStall tell me how Cornyn and Grassley amendments are opposite?
@michaelaadele Cornyn amendment would ensure terrorists on watch lists can't buy weapons. Also protects due process for mistakes w/list.

The bottom line is we can &amp; must do better. Building a bigger Washington doesn’t help America. Ensuring opportunity builds a better America.
"I will work anytime, any place, anywhere, with anyone to tackle the issues facing our poor and low-income communities."
"These are hardworking families, many of which simply need the opportunity in order to succeed."
"When you bring education and jobs, you bring hope and concrete evidence of success. Through investment, we sustain that success."
"As we build on these three pillars - education, jobs and community investment, we can make a huge difference for the poor."
"My #CHOICEAct ensures that parents have the opportunity to ensure their kids get the best education, regardless of their zip code."
"My LEAP Act w/@CoryBooker incentivizes apprenticeships, so folks can earn while they learn. Also encourages manufacturing skills."
My Investing in Opportunity Act encourages private investment in low-income communities w/no new govt program. https://t.co/t4vUZyPWYH #IIOA
"My #OpportunityAgenda seeks to do just that. Empower people, not bureaucrats. Encourage success, not stagnation."
"Its not through more government, but through shaping a system that encourages success."
What I’m looking for is how do we empower people. How do we put hope back into our childrens' minds. How do we kickstart the American Dream.
"Too often people get tangled in the safety net, instead of bouncing back towards success. That’s a fault of the system in place."
"I know that while our current system might have created a poverty floor, it has not widely created opportunities for success."
Having to use the oven to heat your house; watching your grandmother walk 8 miles a day because we couldn't afford the bus - that’s tough.
"Growing up in a poor, single parent household, I know firsthand the struggles folks in low-income communities go through every day."
"Too often over the past 50 years, our answers to fighting poverty have relied on empowering government instead of people."

I am thankful that I live in a country where forgiveness can be seen in the worst of conditions…
How they brought a community together during the worst atrocity in our state's history.
One of the things we can learn through the political process and bringing people together is to remember the families of the nine victims &amp;
"What they simply said in profound words was - ""I forgive you."""
"We see the families of the nine victims and look at what they did at the bond hearing, it was probably the best of who we are as Americans."
Perhaps if there is a moment for us to take a step back from the political process and recognize and appreciate really true righteousness...
"And to this country who's had such an outpouring of affection and love to South Carolina and specifically to Charleston, I say thank you."
"To our friends in the House who -- both Republicans and Democrats reached out to me and reached out to South Carolina, I say thank you"
