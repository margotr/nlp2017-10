"I applaud the President for his excellent choice, and I look forward to enthusiastically working toward Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation."
This vacancy was a central to 2016 campaign &amp; the people have spoken by electing President Trump and returning a Republican Senate majority.
"Judge Gorsuch is a judge’s judge, who is well within the mainstream and always decides cases based on what the law says."
Judge Gorsuch's opinions are well-reasoned &amp; brilliantly written. He has enriched the Tenth Circuit’s jurisprudence in a number of areas.
"Judge Gorsuch is a prepared, thoughtful, and careful jurist, who has demonstrated a strong commitment to textualism and originalism."
I’ve had the privilege of arguing before Judge Gorsuch and he is extremely impressive.

Senate doesn't need to eliminate filibuster. Better solution is to work more than 3 days per week. Allow time for debate and deliberation.
"The real problem in the Senate isn't the filibuster. What we really need is for Senate to be the Senate: an open, deliberative body."
"What a healthy Senate lacks in efficiency, it makes up for with open, robust deliberation."
"The filibuster is about leverage, and that leverage is essential to maintaining equality and engendering deliberation among Senators."
Everything in the Senate is rooted in occupational equality of all Senators - filibuster protects this.
"The Senate is broken, but the filibuster has almost nothing to do with it."

Reagan knew the answer was not to get America to trust Washington; it was to get Washington to trust America: http://t.co/bXCtlK1C5z
A conservative reform agenda is based on something missing in our politics today: respect for the American people: http://t.co/svE6jFGdLS
"We can fix, cut, and tear down walls that confine our liberty—in any era.  We can expect more.  We can expect reform: http://t.co/5VCcdYnu40"
"Just like Reagan did, as conservatives today we need to re-apply our principles to the challenges of the moment: http://t.co/bGaMNbtZG0"
The similarities between the late 1970s and today seem to grow by the hour: http://t.co/fNbCSD2hlW
"We must always remember that in 1976, conservatives found a leader for the ages... but they still lost: http://t.co/qvSqp9GQIo"
Reagan needed a way to transform an anti-liberal majority into a pro-conservative majority: http://t.co/D4xIesUJEp
"Reagan wanted to build a new coalition that wouldn't just cut across party lines, but permanently redraw them: http://t.co/7YLmcA91Vp"
The four-year stretch between 1976 &amp; 1980 was the time that Reagan did perhaps the most important work of his career: http://t.co/8pFHiiJOcJ

The time has come for a new federal transportation policy that taps the creativity of our diverse nation: http://t.co/lseQK0EVO4 #TEAct #HTF
Federal regulatory strings make infrastructure projects unnecessarily expensive &amp; divert resources away from actual infrastructure. #HTF
All Washington adds to transportation policy is unnecessary overhead &amp; self-congratulating press releases trying to take credit for it all.

"Government-driven inequality is the reason why six of the ten wealthiest counties in America are now suburbs of Washington, D.C."
"#Obamacare is an inequality Godzilla that has robbed working families of their insurance, their doctors, their wages and their jobs."
"Inequality is changing laws without congressional approval, &amp; spying on Americans without constitutional authority. http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj"
"Inequality is the federal government hurting rural communities, especially in the West, by controlling and mismanaging public lands."
Inequality is denying citizens the right to define marriage in their states as traditionally or as broadly as their diverse values dictate.
Inequality is blocking thousands of middle-class energy jobs as a favor to partisan donors &amp; radical environmental activists.
#Inequality is guaranteeing insurance companies taxpayer bailouts if #Obamacare cuts into their profits. http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj
"Inequality is penalizing low-income parents for getting married, or getting better jobs: http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj"
Inequality – real inequality - is trapping poor children in failing schools to benefit bureaucrats and union bosses: http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj
"""I’d like to speak especially to those Americans who may feel they have been forgotten by both political parties."" http://t.co/y2y0VKzlhN"
Government creates inequality when it takes rights &amp; opportunities away from American people &amp; gives them to politicians &amp; bureaucrats.
"Tonight, the President’s lofty rhetoric on inequality ignores the fact that his administration has left poor &amp; middle-class families behind."
"Inequality crisis = poor trapped in poverty, middle-class insecurity, and cronyist privilege at the top. http://t.co/rtwXMvGJIH"
"We face an inequality crisis — one to which the President has paid lip-service, but seems uninterested in truly confronting or correcting."
"Today, Americans know in their hearts that something is wrong as the “American Dream” is falling out of reach for far too many of us."
"The founders made a point at Boston Harbor, but they made history in Philadelphia’s Independence Hall."
"In America, the test of any political movement is not what that movement is against, but what it is for."
"It took founders 14 long years to get from Boston to Philadelphia, where they created, with our Constitution, the government they did want."

The Boston Tea Party patriots moved past a protest against the government they didn’t want and marched toward the government they did want.
"In 1773, Americans had simply had it with a London-based national government that had become too big, too expensive and far too intrusive."

My floor speech from earlier today to oppose #Go8 bill: http://t.co/oG2jawVcpp Click on link and help me RT if you share my concerns.
I support immigration reform. But #Go8 is not immigration reform. It is big government dysfunction. I am voting no: http://t.co/0Rx1s0lT78
"There's simply no legitimate reason why we have to pass a one-size-fits-all 1,200-page, take-it-or-leave-it #immigration bill."
the only reason #immigration reform is so controversial is because the Senate refuses to pass it one piece at a time.
The House appears to have learned from #Go8 dysfunction and wants no part of this.  They are passing step-by-step reforms.
The special interests had a huge hand in writing the #Go8 bill while the American people had no role: http://t.co/1XCVo3oPh5
The so-called comprehensive approach has been utterly discredited. #Go8 bill reaffirms why vast majority of Americans distrust Washington.
The #Go8 process has revealed all the problems inherent in passing massive pieces of legislation that try to fix all of problems at once.
"For grand finale, the #Go8 proponents substituted what is effectively a brand-new bill instead of the one we've been debating for 2 months."
"For a 1,200-page bill we were allowed exactly nine roll call votes to amend #Go8 before the process was shut down."
"They said there would be regular order for #Go8 on the floor of the senate, but that turned out to be a false promise as well."
During committee markup Democrats &amp; #Go8 Republicans voted as a block to defeat virtually all substantive amendments to improve the bill.
We were told that if we didn't like what was in #Go8 that we'd have an opportunity to fix it. But that wasn't true either.
"From day one, the country was misled about what was in #Go8 bill. The talking points never matched bill's reality: http://t.co/8uM7N7bSFY"
"As a matter of process, senators should be embarrassed about how #Go8 bill has moved through the senate. http://t.co/ADQzNcmdHx"
"According to CBO, #Go8 will reduce illegal immigration by just a mere 25% over the next ten years: reason alone to scrap entire bill."
"The #Go8 bill transfers too much authority &amp; discretion to the executive branch, exacerbating an already widespread problem in federal gov."
The #Go8 bill remains grossly unfair to those who have languished in our current legal immigration system for decades.
The #Go8 bill cuts the American people out by cutting out congressional oversight of pathway to citizenship process: http://t.co/crWlm7SzM7
"#Go8 bill is full of promises to beef up border security, but it makes no assurances. http://t.co/LRAJAOWJP5"

The only reason #immigration reform is controversial is because the Senate refuses to take it step by step.  http://t.co/px18RB7r1S &lt;See pic
"I have sponsored, cosponsored or could support over half of the 40 #immigration bills introduced in 113th Congress."
There are more than 40 individual pieces of immigration-related legislation that have been introduced in this congress alone.
I support legal #immigration into our country and recognize that immigration is vital to nation's success.
"Far from “good,” S7.44 repeats the mistakes of the past, makes our #immigration system worse, and will lead to bigger problems."
"There are reports that Democrats have asked CBO to evaluate S.744, but report won’t be published until next week. #betterlatethannever"
Proponents of this #immigration bill have so far refused to do their own cost analysis. Taxpayers should know how much it will cost.
WATCH @ChuckGrassley explain how claims that there will be stiff penalties for those who broke law are false. http://t.co/68NYyB7FTH
S.744 is inherently unfair to the many who have tried to navigate our current broken immigration system. #CIRfloor
"I can certainly see why Congress would want to evade responsibility for consequences of S.744, but our republic shouldn't function this way."
"S.744 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security in hundreds of instances, to simply ignore #immigration law. #CIRfloor"
"S.744 surrenders control of #immigration law to the Secretary of Homeland Security and other unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. #CIRfloor"
S.744 leaves Congress and the American people out of the loop. #CIRfloor
"As branch of gov. most accountable to people, Congress must play a vital role in approving, overseeing, and verifying #immigration reforms."
S.744 offers no congressional oversight of how the executive branch implements these immigration reforms. #CIRfloor
"If all we do is fix border-security portion, #immigration bill is still considerably weak in major areas, and is still unworthy of support."
Failing to secure the border is the quickest way to repeat the mistakes of the past. #CIRFloor
"S.744 offers more of same from Washington: plans, promises, commissions, studies and spending, but no action on border security. #CIRfloor"
