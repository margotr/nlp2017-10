"For the good of the nation &amp; for the good of the Senate, there should be no filibuster of Judge Gorsuch."
I hope my Dem colleagues will recognize the need to invoke cloture on Judge Gorsuch’s nomination.
Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge who has earned the respect of his judicial colleagues.
The Senate has a very clear history of rejecting the use of the filibuster against #SCOTUS nominations.
A filibuster of a nominee like Judge Gorsuch would be a tremendous mistake &amp; would harm the Senate as an institution.
.@TheJournalWV echoed these words saying Judge Gorsuch will decide cases regardless of his own preferences
".@IntelligencerWV editorial highlights that Judge Gorsuch is faithful to the #Constitution, not ideology."
Recent @DM_opinion editorial supports Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation &amp; believes he has the strong understanding &amp; respect for our Constitution
"It’s clear from our mtg, a thorough examination of his record &amp; watching last wks hearing, that Judge Gorsuch will rule fairly."
Judge Gorsuch has been through the Senate confirmation process before when he was approved to the 10th circuit w/out opposition.
Judge Scalia left behind a legacy of faithfully applying the law &amp; Judge Gorsuch is a worthy successor.

.@POTUS listened to WV miners &amp; others who struggled. He is making good on his promise and putting them back to work.
.@POTUS' action today is a refreshing change &amp; a promise kept to roll back the #CPP - 1 of the most harmful acts of overreach by Obama admin
"Unfortunately President Obama vetoed our measures to protect affordable, reliable energy &amp; jobs from the #CleanPowerPlan's overreach"
"Last year, I led the charge in the Senate along w/ @SenateMajLdr to overturn harmful #CleanPowerPlan regs for coal power sources"
This Executive Order shows @POTUS is serious about cutting anti-coal regs &amp; reducing unnecessary obstacles for jobs &amp; energy production.

"Senate approves sanctions to limit N. Korea’s nuclear capabilities, cyberattacks &amp; address human rights violations https://t.co/tcL3iwZ6Fz"
This is a step in the right direction and we must continue our fight to permanently block this rule.
"The American ppl should set our energy policy, not an unchecked agency like the @EPA."
"#POTUS stands alone as he attempts to further his climate agenda – the American ppl, Congress &amp; now #SCOTUS do not stand w/ him."
I’m pleased that #SCOTUS has agreed w/ this common sense position and recognized the immediate impact of this rule.
"In 2015, I intro’d my #ARENA Act – legislation that aims to roll back the #CleanPowerPlan"
The #CleanPowerPlan would make things even worse for #WV families &amp; communities that already struggling as a result of these harmful regs.
This landmark decision will prevent #POTUS &amp; his administration from enforcing this rule until all legal challenges are complete.
"On another important note, #SCOTUS announced their decision to put the @EPA’s #CleanPowerPlan on hold."
Similar legislation to strengthen our nat’l security passed in the House last month and I hope the Senate will do the same.
Our current policy toward North Korea has failed to protect the safety and security of the American people.
North Korea poses a very serious threat to the U.S. &amp; these threats will only continue to grow. #StopNorthKorea

"There is a reason that 31 states, including #WV, are suing to overturn the #WOTUS rule &amp; 2 courts already found it likely illegal."
Small businesses were not adequately considered in the #WOTUS rule making process.
.@EPA’s unprecedented expansion of federal authority has very serious consequences both in #WV and throughout the country.

Passing these resolutions sends a message to the world that the American people don’t stand behind #POTUS’s economically catastrophic regs
Congress now has an opportunity to express concerns w/ these carbon mandates &amp; weigh in about whether these regs should go into effect.
"DC policies that pit one state vs. another, &amp; prioritize certain communities &amp; certain jobs vs. others bring livelihoods of many to a halt"
Policies that are ripping the American Dream away from families and communities.
"Policies that help some states &amp; hurt others. Policies that target states like #WV, which produce affordable &amp; reliable energy."
It’s the reality that the policies emanating from #POTUS – our own government – are causing this destruction.
"These regs have far reaching negative effects on schools, home values, electricity bills, &amp; funding for public safety &amp; law enforcement."
"The reality of the families, the faces, the hardships, thousands of layoff notices issued, &amp; jobs that have been lost."
I've expressed these same frustrations before. The difference today is the reality of what we are facing w/ these new carbon regulations.
"I rise today on behalf of WV’s wrkers, families &amp; communities-&amp; all middle class Americans who will bear the burden of these carbon mandates"

ICYMI: Expressed my support for #NDAA &amp; encouraged a full Senate debate on the Energy &amp; Water Appropriations bill: https://t.co/dBNYq1JNm7
Americans deserve a govt that makes wise &amp; strategic investments to best meet their needs
Voting to filibuster this &amp; other approps bills will make the threat of a govt shutdown more likely.
"The Approps Committee did its part, passing all 12 gov funding bills for the first time since '09. 9 of these bills had bipartisan support"
"Funding provided in this bill can help @ARCGov promote rural broadband, expand rural health care services &amp; offer opportunity to our workers"
The Energy &amp; Water Appropriations bill funds programs that help us use our energy resources in the most efficient way possible
The Senate is now considering another bipartisan bill that has important implications for our national security
It would be a mistake for the president to veto funding for our national defense.
This #NDAA provides for our national security needs and will meet our commitments to our allies.
"This important legislation authorizes vital resources for our nation’s troops, our wounded warriors and their families."
About to speak on the @SenateFloor. Will urge #POTUS to sign the defense funding bill &amp; #supportourtroops. Watch: http://t.co/Z6nVEavJGW
