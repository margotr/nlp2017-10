#NDAA authorizes the resources our men &amp; women in uniform need to respond to these crises and do the job the nation asks of them.
"But, the #NDAA is more than just answering these threats. It‚Äôs about helping us here at home, too."
The global turmoil of today highlights why the #NDAA bill before us is so important.
"We remain a nation at war, with thousands of men and women in uniform still deployed to the Middle East and Afghanistan."
#NorthKorea is relentlessly pursuing long-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to our shores.

At 1:50PM #AirForce1 landed at @Offutt_AFB with President George W Bush. For 2 hours @US_Stratcom was the center of U.S. nat‚Äôl defense
"As the day unfolded, @US_Stratcom received notice that the ‚Äúsecure location‚Äù the president would be using was @Offutt_AFB"
.@US_Stratcom worked to identify which planes had been hijacked &amp; monitored the landings of thousands of civilian aircraft.
"When the 2nd plane hit on 9/11, @US_Stratcom understood this was not a fictional threat: America was under attack"
The main purpose of the exercise was to test the military's command and control procedures in the event of nuclear warfare.
"On #September11th 2001, at @Offutt_AFB, @US_Stratcom staff woke up expecting to continue a training exercise"
Sixteen years after the terrorist attacks our nation unites once again to honor the Americans killed on that horrific day.

We must change our strategy to protect Americans. Secondary sanctions and enhanced #MissileDefense should form the basis of our approach.
Kim Jong-un has threatened to attack US cities w/ nuclear weapons. His capability to carry out this threat grows w every passing day
"‚Äúno good options‚Äù is frequently repeated when confronting the NK threat. This may be true, but the gravity of the situation demands action."
I plan to hold hearings in @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte to examine #administrations #MissileDefense review proposed way forward.
The #administration is conducting the first review of ballistic missile threats &amp; our missile defense posture since 2010 #MissileDefense
Deploying more interceptors would add capacity and enable our defenses to better handle ICBM threats #NorthKorea
Rate of NK‚Äôs technical progress demands response eg additional ground-based radars &amp; space-based sensors to impve ability to track threats
As chairman of @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte I work w #MissileDefenseAgency directors &amp; STRATCOM commanders to impve our #MissileDefense
We cannot rely on deterrence alone. We must ensure that our missile defense efforts stay ahead of #NorthKorea's accelerating developments.
The Chinese view #NorthKorea through a narrow lens of immediate strategic interest. That is how we must target our actions.
One thing is certain: the principle economic enablers of #NorthKorea are China and Russia.
NK ICBM developments reveal sophisticated program that is pursuing weapons designed for no other purpose than to threaten the U.S. &amp; allies
Last month NK conducted 2 ICBM tests. A number of reports say the 2nd test demonstrated sufficient range to reach much of the United States.

"Corporal Alexander was laid to rest on May 18, 2007 in Nebraska. Over 1500 people attended to say their final goodbyes."
"On May 6th Matthew spoke to his mother &amp; Kara for the last time. A few days later an IED detonated near him, killing him instantly."
"When Mathew returned to Baqubah, Iraq his unit encountered fierce fighting likened to the close-quarters combat of #Vietnam."
"He returned home from combat and in February of 2007 married his childhood sweetheart, Kara, on Valentine‚Äôs Day."
"Matthew‚Äôs unit deployed to Mosul, Iraq where they assisted with the training of the Iraqi militia #OperationIraqiFreedom"
Matthew enlisted in the Army shortly before graduating from Gretna High School in May of 2004 and shipped off to Basic Training that summer

"Bill was a wonderful husband, brother, son, father. He dedicated quite a bit of his life to helping other people. #NEHeroes"
"Specialist Bailey earned several military awards including the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Iraqi Campaign Medal &amp; Combat Action Badge. #Honor"
More than one thousand people gathered in Bellevue to remember Bill. #NEHeroes
"On May 25, 2007, during a security escort mission, Bill‚Äôs vehicle struck an improvised explosive device. Bill Bailey was killed. #NEHeroes"
"By 2007, the insurgency in Iraq had erupted to new levels of violence. Increased American forces sought to destroy the al Qaeda network."
"In 2006, his unit was deployed and assigned to provide security escorts for truck convoys operating out of Balad Air Base in #Iraq."
"That deep desire to serve the country continued to tug at him. In 2005, Bill re-enlisted in the @NENationalGuard #Courage"
Bill‚Äôs protective nature made him a great father. It also made him a great firefighter. #NeHeroes
"After 9/11, Bill felt the call to serve his country again. But, first things first. Bill and Dee married in 2004."
"In December 2000, Bill met Dee. She was a bank teller at Wells Fargo; he drove an armored truck. They met through a service window."
Bill attended Bellevue East where the call to protect his country prompted him to enlist in the @NENationalGuard in 1995.

Let‚Äôs come together so we can look families in the eye and say: we heard you and we are taking action. #EqualPay #Bipartisan #Empowered
Let‚Äôs take advantage of this moment when we have common ground on a commonsense and straightforward legislation for #EqualPay #Bipartisan
Most importantly this bill is possible: 53 Republican and 5 Dem Senators supported a version of the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct last Congress.
Many congressional Democrats requested and even praised an Obama executive order with similar language to my proposal #EqualPay
"Importantly for employers, the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct wouldn't impose new federal regulations or mandates"
"With this flexibility, women can better negotiate arrangements that make sense for them. #Flexibility"
"When employees, especially women, have more information, they can confidently pursue favorable work and wage arrangements #KnowledgeIsPower"
A culture of silence and fear of retaliation can keep people in the dark about how their wages compare to others‚Äô #KnowledgeIsPower
The #WorkplaceAdvancementAct would empower women with info about wages so they can be informed advocates for themselves.
I‚Äôve reintro‚Äôd the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct based on a simple idea: equal pay through empowerment #KnowledgeIsPower https://t.co/4ifgWsmas9

The #DIGITAct is a bipartisan bill. Both parties understand the need to position the US as a #IoT world leader.
The #DIGITAct will bring together a working group of federal agencies &amp; private sector stakeholders to develop #IoT
Cooperation between the private and public sectors is essential to develop the #IoT.

Germaine Debro was promoted posthumously to the rank of sergeant. #NEheroes
"On September 18, 2006, the Morning Star Baptist Church near downtown Omaha was filled with people paying a final tribute to Sgt. Debro."
"Sergeant Josiah Warren, riding in the right seat, tried unsuccessfully to pull Germaine free. Sgt. Debro died on 9/4/06"
"Thirty miles outside Baghdad, Germaine‚Äôs Humvee struck an improvised explosive device."
"On September 4, 2006, a 20-truck convoy headed out from a site 30 miles north of Baghdad."
Germaine‚Äôs unit was right in the thick of it. Enemy attacks were frequent. Tensions were high.
"After a year of training, the First of the 167th Cavalry arrived in Iraq in early 2006. That‚Äôs when the Sunni-Shia civil war erupted."
"In 2005, Germaine learned his unit, the First of the 167th Cavalry of the @NEnationalGuard, would deploy to Iraq."
Germaine deployed to Kuwait in 2001 and to Bosnia in 2002. #ProudNebraskan #NEheroes

At @AEI: @POTUS &amp; @HillaryClinton support the non-retaliation clause in my #WorkplaceAdvancementAct
Kicking off Q&amp;A on #equalpay &amp; #paidleave at @AEI. Watch: Webcast ‚Üí https://t.co/4w9U54EiEO
I believe we can achieve meaningful change that can help both #employees and #businesses thrive. #paidleave 14/14 https://t.co/57t62QFbjx
"Whether it‚Äôs #EqualPay or #PaidLeave, the issues that matter to American workers are evolving. This progress demands solutions. 13/14"
No one should live w/ the fear that welcoming a new baby or taking an elderly parent to the doctor could mean losing a job #paidleave 12/14
Rigid mandates can actually hurt workers‚Äô ability to negotiate unique arrangements with employers. 11/14
"Every situation is different, &amp; by providing more options, workers can determine how each can suit their own needs. #paidleave 10/14"
In Nov I joined Sen Angus King of Maine to reintro a bill that encourages employers to voluntarily offer paid leave to their employees 9/14
I believe it‚Äôs possible to find a middle ground on #equalpay &amp; #paidleave that respects both #families &amp; employers 8/14
An ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù attitude only prevents #progress &amp; leaves us with the false choices &amp; stereotypes that have persisted for decades. 7/14
I believe that every #AmericanWorker should have the ability to discuss compensation w/out fear of retribution. https://t.co/gwrz9bJhIL 6/14
"To make a difference in the lives of working #families, we must build bipartisan consensus. 5/14 https://t.co/RbWU2iqR0O"
We should be empowering both employers &amp; employees to #negotiate flexible work arrangements to best meet their individual needs. 4/14
Current law doesn‚Äôt adequately protect workers against retaliation for openly discussing their salaries. #equalpay 3/14
I want to put a stop to unfair pay practices. This starts by breaking the barriers to open discussion. #equalpay 2/14
I believe that #Congress has a duty to promote policies that will make life easier &amp; more flexible for American #families. 1/14
NOW: I‚Äôm speaking at @AEI on #PaidLeave &amp; #EqualPay. Tune in here: https://t.co/TErY4VnHkV

"1st Lt Jacob Fritz is a hero, and I am honored to tell his story. #NEHeroes 12/12"
Jake‚Äôs memory lives on in the hearts and minds of the state he served. Nebraskans are forever indebted to his sacrifice. 11/12
"Jake was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Prisoner of War Medal, and the Combat Action Badge. 10/12"
"First Lieutenant Jacob Fritz received full military honors was laid to rest in Verdon, NE on January 31, 2007. 9/12"
"When American troops arrived at the scene, they saw his body and the word ‚ÄúFritz.‚Äù #Courage #Honor 8/12"
"Mortally wounded, Jake knew he wouldn‚Äôt be identified and managed to scrawl a few letters in the dust. #NEHereos 7/12"
"Jake and 3 other soldiers were taken hostage, stripped of their identification, and shot as the militants fled the scene. 6/12"
"Shortly after he arrived, on January 20, 2007, enemy militants disguised as friendly soldiers, entered Karbala and attacked. 5/12"
Lieutenant Fritz had a natural instinct to step up and take charge. He felt an obligation and commitment to the mission. 4/12
"In 2006, Jake was deployed to Iraq as a Lieutenant with the 2nd Battalion 3/12"
Jake graduated from @WestPoint_USMA in 2005 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in systems engineering. 2/12
"Jake Fritz grew up on his family‚Äôs farm near Verdon, Nebraska, a town with less than 200 people. 1/12"

"Mr. President, what is your top priority? Mine is providing for the natl defense. #SignIt"
It‚Äôs time for #POTUS to make #NDAA his top priority.
The federal government has no higher obligation than protecting our nation &amp; providing for our national security.
"Instead, he vetoed the NDAA based on a partisan, political demand to spend taxpayer dollars on the EPA &amp; IRS."
#POTUS‚Äô objections have nothing to do with our national security.
Our military needs the authorities contained in this bill to perform its missions &amp; defend our nation.
"As we have seen from the ever-growing list of global threats, these dangers are only increasing."
This year‚Äôs #NDAA is a #bipartisan compromise that meets the budgetary levels requested by #POTUS
It‚Äôs disappointing to see our commander in chief playing political games at the expense of our military.

To recklessly gamble our only source of leverage would be far worse than signing no deal at all. #IranDeal
We cannot undo sanctions for an agreement that is built on the hope that the Iranian gov't changes its behavior.
The international sanctions regime took years to assemble &amp; remains the most effective method of imposing costs on #Iran.
"POTUS argued that we ‚Äògive nothing up‚Äô by ‚Äòtesting‚Äô whether this agreement will constrain Iran‚Äôs nuclear ambitions, I disagree."
