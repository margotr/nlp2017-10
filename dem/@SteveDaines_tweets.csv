It is irresponsible for Washington to increase the limit on the nation’s credit card while busting the budget and increasing spending.
The deal takes our nation in the opposite direction with the false promise of far off savings and new revenues that will never materialize.

"In light of all we have learned about the NSA’s unlawful bulk data collection program, it’s clear that reforms must happen."
It’s illegal. It’s an overreach of power. And it’s a direct threat to our First and Fourth Amendment rights.
The NSA bulk data program is a direct threat to our Constitutional rights. Jeopardizes our civil liberties with little proven effectiveness.
"Like so many Montanans, I am deeply concerned about the NSA’s bulk metadata collection program and its impact on our Constitutional rights."
Walking onto the Senate floor to join @RandPaul. Bulk collection is a violation of our 4th Amendment Rights. WATCH: http://t.co/kFOPzQ6iQY
Standing with Montanans and headed to the Senate floor to speak against the NSA's unlawful invasion of our privacy. #StandWithRand
