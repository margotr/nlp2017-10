The Senate has confirmed Neil Gorsuch to #SCOTUS. I'd like to thank @POTUS for his leadership and for sending such an excellent nominee.
Judge Neil #Gorsuch has been confirmed by the #Senate to the Supreme Court. https://t.co/RXuW6zzI1y

I'll be joining @hughhewitt tomorrow morning to discuss Judge #Gorsuch's nomination to #SCOTUS.
There will now be up to 30 hours of debate prior to the vote to confirm @GorsuchFacts. He will be our 9th #SCOTUS Justice by tomorrow night.
