I look forward to hearing how the administration is moving this important work forward.
Congress passed CARA &amp; #21stCenturyCures in a bipar way to provide funding &amp; update pgrms to assist states &amp; help combat the opioid crisis.
And about what policies FDA has put in place to make sure that the opioid alternatives submitted to FDA are prioritized appropriately (2/2)
I want to hear today about the public-private partnership that NIH is leading (1/2)
The most ambitious goal of #21stCenturyCures was to drive research discoveries predicted by @NIHDirector including non-addictive painkillers
I hope today’s panel of witnesses can give this committee an update on the federal response to the crisis – what’s working &amp; what needs work
"This is a crisis. Not just in Tennessee, but across the country."
"Last yr., 1,631 Tennesseans died of drug overdose--12% more than the yr. before--mostly due to an increase in overdoses of synthetic opioids"
The amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S. in 2015 was enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for three weeks
"The opioid crisis is tearing our communities &amp; families apart, &amp; posing an enormous challenge to health care providers and law enforcement"

"The sooner we pass this legislation, the better—to give patients, doctors, FDA reviewers, and companies certainty."
A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the reviews of drugs and devices submitted after April 1

"The FDA Reauthorization Act, sponsored by me &amp; Senator Murray, reauthorizes the four user fee agreements that expire at the end of September"
The FDA is the agency responsible for making sure the promise of the 21st Century Cures Act actually reaches America’s patients
Now the next step ... is to fund the Food and Drug Administration.
"21st Century Cures became law last year and provided $4.8 billion for medical research, on top of the support Congress already provides"
"This was legislation to spur research and development of cures, devices and treatments for some of the most deadly illnesses and diseases"

Here is the problem with missing the goal of having this to the President’s desk before August recess:
We need to make sure we can get user fee reauthorization done by Aug recess—meaning we need to report this legislation to Senate floor today
"The FDA Reauthorization Act, sponsored by me &amp; Senator Murray, reauthorizes the four user fee agreements that expire at the end of September"
We have followed the same sort of bipartisan process on how we continue funding the FDA
"The year before that, we worked in a bipartisan way to fix No Child Left Behind."

I look forward to Mr. Acosta’s confirmation today.
We are fortunate that someone of Mr. Acosta’s intelligence and experience is willing to serve as our United States Secretary of Labor.
"Supporters of Acosta’s nomination include @USChamber, @NRFnews , @NFIB, @ShopFloorNAM, @Franchising411, &amp; @AmeriBev."
Mr. Acosta understands that a good-paying job is critical to helping workers realize the American dream for themselves &amp; for their families.
Mr. Acosta has excellent credentials and is well-qualified for the position.

Dr. Gottlieb strikes me as the kind of nominee that is easy to support.
"He has served as a practicing physician and hospitalist as well as a former FDA Deputy Commissioner, and he is also a cancer survivor."
"He is supported by former FDA commissioners Robert Califf, Margaret Hamburg and Mark McClellan."
I believe throughout this process Dr. Gottlieb has demonstrated that he is the right person to lead the FDA on its vital mission.
Dr. Gottlieb has been through an exhaustive vetting process.

We may soon have a situation where no insurance company is willing to sell insurance on an #Obamacare exchange
"If the #Obamacare policyholder isn’t paying the higher premiums in the exchange, then you, the taxpayer, will..."
The bill I am introducing will not fix #Obamacare. It is not a permanent solution. We still must repeal &amp; replace the law.
A growing number of states--including #TN--that have multiple insurers have only one insurer selling policies in a majority of counties
"People buying on #Obamacare exchanges will have only 1 insurer to choose from in the entire state in 5 states next year: AL, AK, OK, SC, WY"
"2: Waive #Obamacare requirement that you buy a specific health care plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four next year"
"1: States w failing #Obamacare exchange could allow residents to purchase any health plan, even those off the exchange, for 2017"
This legislation will do 2 things for the nearly 11 million Americans who buy health insurance on the #Obamacare exchanges
"You may be eligible for an #Obamacare subsidy..but there’s also a good chance the insurance you currently have may be gone by November,"
It takes a certain amount of creativity for Senate Dems to come to the floor and complain about #Zika funding--THEY refused the vote.
