"10/ If Democrats won't allow Judge Gorusch a vote, they won’t allow anyone a vote. #ConfirmGorsuch"
"9/ Even Justice Clarence Thomas, who was confirmed 52-48, a razor thin margin, was not filibustered on the Senate floor."
8/ I agree w/@marcthiessen who wrote in @WashingtonPost “the idea that Gorsuch should be the first [filibustered] is patently absurd.”
7/ @PittsburghPG is right: “Democrats… should accept reality… they’d end up losing a battle to kill his nomination.”
6/ @NYTimes reports “There has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.” Dems wrong to start now.
"5/ While @SenSanders falsely claims there is a 60-vote standard, @GlennKesslerWP awards #ThreePinocchios: https://t.co/UIWWOKhQd8"
"4 /In a historically unprecedented move, many of my Democratic colleagues have decided to filibuster Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation."

I do not believe that Mr. Adegbile demonstrated such a commitment in his handling of the Mumia Abu-Jamal case.
This requires the head of the Civil Rights Division to have an absolute commitment to truth and justice.
The mission of the DOJ division that Mr. Adegbile would lead is to uphold the civil and constitutional rights of all individuals.
"Lawyers managed by Mr. Adegbile distorted the facts in the case for Mumia Abu-Jamal, the unrepentant murderer of Officer Faulkner."
Mr. Adegbile’s record raises serious questions about his judgment and fitness to execute the duties of assistant attorney general.
I oppose the nomination of Debo Adegbile to head the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

RT @BrookingsEcon: .@SenToomey is now answering a few questions from the audience: http://t.co/w0SW3bRp #BIToomey
We have to have the will to put our country on a sustainable fiscal path. #BIToomey
A strong economic recovery is possible. It’s up to us. #BIToomey
Pro-growth tax reform would kickstart a surge of investment and economic growth. We would see the recovery we've been waiting for. #BIToomey
"If we put entitlements on sustainable path, we ensure their survival. Most important thing to avoid fiscal crisis we're courting. #BIToomey"
We need to reform the entitlement programs driving our fiscal problems -- we have to agree on the fundamental problem. #BIToomey
"There's little dispute if we do pro-growth tax reform right, it will generate economic growth and the jobs that come with it. #BIToomey"
We can use the next year to do what we need – pro-growth tax reform. #BIToomey
We should extend the current tax rates for another year; they've been in place for 12 yrs. Then use next year to reform tax code. #BIToomey
"I think there’s a better way than going over the fiscal cliff, as some of my colleagues have recommended. #BIToomey"
"Our plan ensured the lower brackets did not have increases. The tax code would become more progressive, not less progressive. #BIToomey"
That's why I find it so objectionable that those who knew better say we wanted to increase taxes on middle class to pay for rich. #BIToomey
We stipulated right at the beginning of this arrangement that all net new revenue come from the top two brackets. #BIToomey
Strong bipartisan consensus that we needed corp. tax reform. Supercommittee had unlimited jurisdiction -- we could have done that. #BIToomey
My supercommittee proposal offered $500B of new revenue. We were meeting them at the halfway point. #BIToomey
"Any new revenue had to come in conjunction with new pro-growth tax reform, which bipartisan deficit commissions have recommended. #BIToomey"
"Democrats wanted a huge tax increase, but they were not willing to begin to solve the real problem. #BIToomey"
"What Republican supercommittee members wanted was to make structural reforms to at least one entitlement, make it sustainable. #BIToomey"
No significant government program can grow faster than our economy indefinitely. All three big entitlements are growing faster. #BIToomey
Watch my @BrookingsInst speech live at 9 a.m. http://t.co/IOeI93Ny I'll set the record straight on my supercommittee proposal. #BIToomey
