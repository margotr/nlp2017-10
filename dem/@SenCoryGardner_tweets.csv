I hope a future Administration reverses this dangerous course &amp; puts the Iranian regime under pressure necessary to truly change behavior.
"Iran has funded terror. Iran will continue to fund terror. Now, however, they have billions more to do it with."
Soleimani is responsible for supplying IEDs to Iraqi insurgents to kill Americans.
"Notably, Iran recently violated U.N. travel restrictions by sending abroad Qassem Soleimani, a known terrorist &amp; Iranian General."
"Just since this deal was announced, Iran has conducted multiple illegal ballistic missile tests. They've held American sailors at gunpoint."
The Administration seems convinced that endless concessions to Iran will provoke a behavior change. That has proven to be laughably false.
Groups funded by Iran have killed innocents in Syria. They've killed Israelis. They've killed Americans.
Many of us warned money released to the Iranian regime would fund terror. Sec. Kerry has now admitted as much. https://t.co/Am0OLTkMW2

Disgraceful that Senate Democrats just denied American people a voice in one of the most consequential foreign policy issues of our time.
The Administration is promising to defend our allies in the Middle East from the very guns and missiles that their deal will hand to Iran.
The only element of bipartisanship on the floor of the Senate today is in opposition to this bad deal with the Iranian regime.
Why does Iran need ballistic missiles and conventional small arms to produce isotopes for medical purposes? This deal gives those to them.
When did a bad option before the United States Senate become the only option? Why should we accept second best? #BadIranDeal

Iran already violating UN sanctions &amp; ignoring portions of #IranDeal. Raises major questions about deal's viability. http://t.co/al1i6ENCHm
My letter to Pres. Obama asking for Administration's plan to hold Iran accountable for violations already committed: http://t.co/al1i6F5dyU
"The fundamental issue of Iran Deal: Far too reliant on ""compliance"" of a terror-funding, murderous regime with American blood on its hands."
"Iran can ""comply"" with nuclear deal, violate arms embargo repeatedly, and yet embargo &amp; sanctions lifted over time. http://t.co/U3KU3C7APo"
Iranian actions highly concerning. As is Administration's response: Sec. Kerry says arms embargo violations do not cause sanction snapbacks.
"Theoretically, agreement prevents Iranian ballistic missile tests. Iran claims this isn't binding. They go forward. http://t.co/gO1mcrs2sz"
Soleimani's travel not sole issue. Iranian media reports the regime will conduct ballistic missile tests this year. http://t.co/gO1mcrs2sz
Soleimani traveling in defiance of UN sanctions raises questions about Iranian compliance with proposed nuclear deal. http://t.co/EUBG0jY7KL
Iran is said to be responsible for around 500 US military deaths in Iraq. Soleimani led Iran's efforts to supply Iraqi insurgents.
"Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, for example, recently travelled to Russia in violation of UN Sanctions. http://t.co/EUBG0jGwmb"

Right to keep and bear arms is cherished by millions of Americans. Depriving military recruiters of that right is totally counterproductive.
"A sidearm ban does nothing to keep military recruiters safe, and instead disarms the very people best qualified to help avert a tragedy."
Our military men &amp; women are among the most skilled firearms users in the world. Prohibiting them from carrying sidearms makes no one safer.
"Proud to cosponsor @SteveDaines SEMPER FI Act, which would allow military to arm officers at recruiting stations. A nonsensical prohibition."

UN-first gambit an affront to Congress' Constitutional role &amp; the Iran Nuclear Review Act signed by President Obama. http://t.co/oDiHUkX2kq
"Until Congress votes, the United States has not agreed to a deal. Administration should have waited to go to the UN. http://t.co/oDiHUkX2kq"
Going to the U.N. before the U.S. Congress is a grave mistake on the part of the Obama Administration. http://t.co/oDiHUkX2kq
Retweet if you think the Iran deal should be approved first by the U.S. Congress - not the United Nations. http://t.co/oDiHUkX2kq
Read my full statement on the United Nations vote on Iran today: http://t.co/E7mLgKFGkC
Congress must fully review this agreement before the Administration grants Iran those concessions.
"The Iranian regime has waited years for a lifted arms embargo, allowing them to buy more weapons for Hamas and Hezbollah to aim at Israel."
The Iranian regime has waited years to receive the billions in frozen offshore accounts which they can use to fund international terror.
The Iranian regime has waited years for the international nuclear legitimacy which the Obama Administration seems determined to grant them.
"The American people &amp; representatives in Congress have 60 days to review this deal, agreed to in the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act."
"Coming on the heels of the Administration's seemingly endless concession-granting to the Iranians in Vienna, this UN action is unacceptable."
"The Administration pattern: mislead the Congress, avoid the American people, and use extraconstitutional actions to advance their Iran deal."
I condemn the Administration’s decision to take their Iran deal to the UN before the US Congress in the strongest possible terms.
Today's UN vote sets the stage for sanctions against Iran to be lifted and Iran’s considerable ledger of past violations to be wiped clean.
"Seemingly, the Administration would rather run to UN bureaucrats for rubber-stamp approval than make the case for their deal on its merits."
The Administration’s decision to take the Iran nuclear agreement to the UN before the US Congress is a grave mistake.

"Iran sponsors terror worldwide. Against America, Israel, others. What will they do with billions in sanctions relief? With no arms embargo?"
"Iranian-backed militias have killed Americans in Iraq. Iran backs the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad in Syria."
"Great to see New Horizons, with Colorado technology from Boulder, Littleton, Longmont, and elsewhere, reach Pluto. http://t.co/GYrYQw2f7T"
The Administration's false choice - either support their bad deal or be in favor of war in the Middle East - must be rejected categorically.
"This deal is an accommodation of a regime whose President proudly walks in front of parades chanting ""Death to America"" &amp; ""Death to Israel""."
Sanctions relief in this deal would give Iran billions to pour directly into their network of international terrorist organizations.
This deal would make Iran a globally-approved nuclear threshold state. It would put Israel in severe danger.
"Deal lifts the arms embargo against Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terror. And the more detail we learn, the worse it seems."

WH Exec Order 13694 can impose sanctions against entities which threaten US NatSec or economic/financial health via cyber. Use it. #OPMHack
And what is the plan to prevent the next #OPMHack? It's been months. The American people deserve to know.
What is the plan to hold the individuals or entities who perpetrated the #OPMHack accountable? Indictments? Sanctions?
Has the #OPMHack been raised with the PRC’s ambassador to the US? Was it raised at the US-China Strategic &amp; Economic dialogue last month?
"If China is involved, as suggested in reports, what diplomatic efforts is the Administration taking? If none, why? What's the delay?"
What does the Administration know about who hacked our government? Are they ever planning on informing Americans?
How soon after the breach did the administration ID the perpetrators and/or state sponsors? Why don’t we know this already?
Missing on #OPMHack? Discussion of the perpetrators. Admin officials go on background with reporters to accuse China. Publicly? Nothing.
"The Administration now, after 3 months, says 22 million are affected. Other reports put the number higher. A massive, unprecedented breach."
The Obama Administration response to the #OPMHack has been lacking on multiple fronts.
