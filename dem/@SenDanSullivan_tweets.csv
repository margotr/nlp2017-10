"The Rebuild America Now Act would prevent billions from being wasted in red tape/litigation, make it easier to overhaul U.S. infrastructure."
"My bill will include a builder's &amp; worker's bill of rights, requiring timely permitting decisions, and transparency from federal agencies."
"Rebuild America Now Act would limit sue-and-settle practices used by radical groups to abuse the judicial system, delay projects to death."
This simple one-in one-out rule on federal regulations has been successfully implemented in the UK and Canada. #RegulationNation
"My bill would also cap regulations, requiring old regs to be eliminated for every new reg enacted by a federal agency (RED Tape Act)."
"Rebuild America Now Act would (2) create 1-stop shop for environmental reviews, ensuring projects don't get bogged down by endless agencies."
"In new Congress, I will introduce the Rebuild America Now Act - (1) establishes time limits for approval/denial of permits for good cause."
President-elect @realDonaldTrump is set to reverse Obama Admin's abysmal permitting record. Members of Congress should join this effort.
"Labor leader Terry O'Sullivan, with @LIUNA, called Pres. Obama's actions a “cynical manipulation of the approval process.” #RegulationNation"
#KeystoneXL languished in permitting purgatory for two Obama terms before the President finally killed it in 2015. #RegulationNation
"Obama Admin's capricious permitting was part of why @Shell halted its #Alaska operations, stranding resources and killing 1000s of jobs."

"Extra costs on small business will trickle down 2 workers, likely in the form of reduced benefits and reduced wages. #Obamacare #CadillacTax"
Cadillac Tax will hit estimated 90 percent of #Alaska businesses. Employer with 20 employees will pay estimated $28K more a year. #Obamacare
"5yrs after #Obamacare, 1 in 3 Americans putting off medical treatment because of cost; among highest tally in 14yr. https://t.co/faYbDFwXHV"

"In Anchorage, cheapest bronze plan increasing 46% in 1 year - among biggest hikes for metro area in U.S. #Obamacare https://t.co/oqMjrHCrwj"
Of the 5 insurance companies that offered plans on #Alaska exchange only 2 remain. Both are increasing premiums by 40% this year. #Obamacare
"Fmr Speaker Pelosi: #Obamacare will create “4 million jobs—400,000 almost immediately.” CBO: Bill will result in 2mill. fewer jobs by 2017."

"In #Fairbanks, small business owner had coverage for employees, now has to dump them into exchange to fend for themselves. #Obamacare"
Hardly a day passes where I don’t hear from Alaskans facing #Obamacare crisis. Eg: Couple now paying $3K/month in premiums—nearly $38K/year.
"Recently in AK, in just 2 hours I was told by AKns at 3 different places that #Obamacare is wiping out their home income, small business."
"Glad to join 51 of my colleagues in passing a repeal of #Obamacare, marking 1st time a repeal bill will end up on the President's desk."

First time ever a President has vetoed #NDAA over issues having nothing to do with defense policies within the bill.
"For only 4th time in past half century, President has vetoed #NDAA, critical funding for our troops to keep our country safe."
#NDAA sits on @POTUS desk. It is time to let the White House know you oppose the President’s veto of critical funding for our troops.
"I don’t know how the Commander in Chief is going to explain #NDAA veto to our troops, their families, or the American people. #FundOurTroops"
To govern is to choose. To govern is to prioritize. Is White House more focused on freeing funds for Iran than our brave service members?
"Minority Leader Reid has called #NDAA vote a “waste of time.” Tell that to the soldiers, airmen &amp; sailors defending our country right now."
Among items on chopping block from a @POTUS #NDAA veto: troop pay bonuses and improved retirement benefits. #FundOurTroops
#IranDeal allows money to flow to terrorist groups. President’s #NDAA veto eliminates resources for our troops to fight terrorists.

"With respect to @POTUS, he will be gone in a year and a half; American people will live with security implications of #IranDeal for decades."

"Obama admin. has been dismissive of American people from beginning, not wanting them to weigh in thru elected representatives. #IranDeal"
"Iranian Parliament needs majority to pass #IranDeal. But thanks to Senate Dems, world’s greatest democracy will not. Another humiliation."
First time in U.S. history such grave and important matter to nat. security moves forward with partisan minority in both houses. #IranDeal
#IranDeal is what happens when a pariah state is steering the negotiations. This is how dangerous policy is made. https://t.co/LUS81e9gQ8
#BadIranDeal is result of echo chamber; when you want deal too badly and unwilling 2 walk away from table; when you ignore American people.
.@JohnKerry: Congress rejection of #BadIranDeal “will be the ultimate screwing” to Ayatollah who “constantly believed we are untrustworthy.”
"When #BadIranDeal negotiations began, Iran was isolated. Now, our most important ally in Middle East, Israel, is considered pariah state."
"Scope and # of concessions solidify sense that #BadIranDeal slowly, subtly cedes our power to what was until recently world’s pariah state."
"#BadIranDeal gives Iranians, largest state sponsor of terrorism, billions of dollars upfront—that’s not concession; that’s surrender."
"Following agreement, @POTUS says: “New relationship with Iran.” Iranians chant: “Death to America.” #BadIranDeal"
"When we agreed to lift Gen. Soleimani/Quds Force sanctions, as @JoniErnst said, that was a slap in face of our veterans. #BadIranDeal"
Secret side deal unequivocally based on trusting Iran. Not a concession; it is a humiliation. And IAEA has never done this b4. #BadIranDeal
"After @POTUS claims #BadIranDeal had nothing to do with trusting Iran, we’re told by Admin. Iranians will inspect themselves. Unbelievable."
Official described side deal: Iran conducts Parchin inspections alone. Every jaw in the room dropped. We couldn’t believe it. #BadIranDeal
In closed briefing Admin. official said she read but wasn’t allowed copy of inspections side deal. Just between IAEA and Iran. #BadIranDeal
"Today we remember those we lost, &amp; give thanks for 1st responders who keep us safe and military members who defend our nation. #NeverForget"
All negotiations require compromise. But at a certain point concessions become humiliations if too significant and frequent. #BadIranDeal
"Americans overwhelmingly oppose #BadIranDeal by a 2-to-1 margin. More public knows about the deal, the more they dislike it."
Even supporters of #BadIranDeal are saying they have “serious concerns” calling it “seriously flawed” &amp; “falls short in many areas.”
Particularly visceral opposition of #BadIranDeal among Alaska’s veterans. #Alaska has highest number of vets per capita of any state.
"During August work period in #Alaska attending town halls, roundtables all across state—not a single Alaskan said to support #BadIranDeal."
"If Senate were to reimpose sanctions in event of Iran terrorist event, regime can cite P. 26 or P. 37 and legally walk from #BadIranDeal."
Administration says sanctions will “snap back” overnight. That’s a fallacy. Economic isolation of Iran took years. #BadIranDeal
".@JohnKerry said no grandfather clause in #BadIranDeal. P. 37 clearly says if sanctions reimposed, no retroactive effect on Iran contracts."
"Agree w/ @SenDanCoats: agreement is filled with ambiguities/open to interpretation, including by Iranians. #BadIranDeal"
Last year 83 senators signed letter to @POTUS detailing strategic goals of nuclear negotiations. #BadIranDeal achieved none of them.
I will be on Senate floor shortly to explain why I oppose the #BadIranDeal. Watch here: http://t.co/DstQyHZLQo
Bottom line: The #IranDeal does not dismantle regime’s nuclear weapons program. That was/should have remained the prerequisite of any deal.
"Administration offers false choice: #IranDeal or war. Sanctions relief should only be granted for improved behavior, step by step."
"98 senators supported bill allowing Congress to review #IranDeal. Hope my colleagues don’t filibuster historic matter, allow us to vote."
AP unveiled IAEA deal for Iran to collect own inspection samples. How can anyone vote for #IranDeal without details of secret side deals?
"Quds Force Gen. Soleimani, responsible for killing/maiming 1000s of American soldiers, gets sanctions relief under #IranDeal. Reprehensible."
"Khamenei: Israel gone within 25 years. @SenSchumer: If Iran intends 2 acquire nuclear weapon, must simply exercise patience under #IranDeal."
Sec. @JohnKerry: No #IranDeal is better than a bad deal. Releasing $100bil. to largest sponsor of terror w/no behavior change IS a bad deal.
So-called “snap back” of sanctions is a fantasy. Sanctions took years of intense effort to get countries and businesses to divest. #IranDeal

Wishing a very special #18th birthday to my daughter Meghan! http://t.co/KZhvpaloRM
"Mr. President, the people who sent us here still have big dreams and big hopes. Let’s help those dreams grow and their hopes flourish."
There is NO doubt of that.
"Despite challenges, despite big-govt’s creep into our lives, despite armed EPA agents, we continue to live in greatest country in the world."
"I believe our government should be helping, not hindering, these efforts."
And I think most of us can agree that we must unleash the country’s enormous economic potential once again.
We want a government that holds dear what our fathers knew – that all powers are derived from the consent of the governed.
"We want to continue to live in the best country in the world, a country of unlimited opportunity, a country of Alaska-sized dreams."
We want our children to be safe and secure and we want the same for our neighbor.
We want to be strong here at home which will help us be respected once again by our allies and feared by our adversaries.
We all want the very best for the people we represent and the states we speak for.
"let me close with a few words about how I view my mission here.
I suspect it doesn’t differ from what most of us here hope to accomplish."
And finally we must challenge the conventional wisdom that the federal government’s power &amp;  intrusiveness should always be expanding
"Fourth: while I believe in a limited fed. govt, we must recognize where the fed. govt DOES have responsibilities -- like protecting our Vets"
Third: we must get back to the rule of law.
"Second, we need more, not less, access to our federal lands. As Americans, these are OUR lands – not the @Interior or @BLMNational"
Let me suggest a few ideas: First – We MUST stop delaying economic projects that benefit our citizens.
We must work to once again unleash the great potential that is Alaska and America &amp; we must work to reinvigorate faith in the American dream
Congress has a job to do. We must work to address the anxiety and frustration of the people we serve.
"What the American people are telling us, is that they want a federal government that helps ignite their hope, not smother it."
Our citizens are telling us that their government has gone well beyond deriving its powers from the consent of the governed.
"And judging from what Americans are telling us, the reach of the federal government has exceeded its limits."
"Since the founding of this country, we’ve had important debates right here on this floor about the role of the fed. government in our lives."
"Yes, we have major challenges like all states. But in Alaska, we still have hope, we still dream big dreams. TAPS helps fuel these dreams."
I’m standing in support of what has defined this country for centuries: The idea of the American dream.
"In supporting Keystone, I’m  standing for a larger principle. The ideal that the fed. govt should be a partner in progress. Not an obstacle."
Today I stand in support of Keystone. As an Alaskan I feel it’s important to talk about this bill &amp; the importance of energy infrastructure
