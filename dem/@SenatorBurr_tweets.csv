Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe will testify before an open hearing of the Senate Intel Cmte tomorrow.
"His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the Bureau and the nation."
Dir. Comey has been more forthcoming w/ information than any FBI Director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intel committees.
"In my interactions w/ the Director and w/ the Bureau under his leadership, he &amp; the FBI have always been straightforward with our Committee."
His dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.
I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order.
I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey’s termination.

May God continue to bless America. #September11
"We are a nation of heroes, and today we have the opportunity to stand amongst them, to thank them, and to honor those lost."
We send our thoughts and prayers to those who are currently serving in the darkest and most hostile places on the planet.
Let us today remember those who lost their lives on 9/11 and those who have since made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
It is only together that we can successfully confront and defeat vile ideologies that seek to do us harm and destroy our way of life.
"Friends and allies around the world stand with us, and we must stand with them."
"The evil of ISIL and al-Qaida, and related and similar groups around the world, suffers no restraints except those that we impose upon it."
I can tell you that we are up to the challenge – as long as we do not forget the past. #September11
"Today is a day for remembrance, it must also be a day for refocusing: the threat to America and her allies is real and unrelenting."
"For our intelligence professionals, every day must be treated like September 12, 2001, with a constant refrain: ‘Never again’"
"They, too, have been working around the clock since the early hours after #September11."
"The intelligence professionals, military and civilian, who serve America do an incredible job."
"There are others in our nation’s service who are far less visible, yet equally worthy of our praise and admiration."
"These men and women, regardless of the color of the uniform they wear, are serving with honor to ensure we are secure at home."
"There are countless others who have heeded the call to duty, serving at home and abroad to keep an aggressive, resourceful enemy at bay."
"The 82nd Airborne, 2nd Marine Division, special operations forces, &amp; 4th Fighter Wing, are often called upon to be the first to fight."
"Many of those heroes hail from towns we are so familiar with: Fayetteville, Jacksonville, Cherry Point, Goldsboro"
"We cannot, and will not, forget. #September11"
"Thousands have returned from the battlefield with grievous injuries, and so many have made the ultimate sacrifice."
Our service members and their families continue to sacrifice on behalf of all of us. #September11
"Come October, they will have been at war for 15 years, taking the fight to the enemy so the enemy doesn’t bring the fight to our homes."
"Our military remains engaged with the enemy in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and in other parts of the world."
"In communities across our nation, first responders stand ready to put their lives on the line so that others might live."
"Our first responders, continue today as they did then: rushing toward the fire and the chaos, while most rush away."
We must also remember the sacrifices made by so many others since #September11.
I ask all of you to keep those families in your thoughts and prayers today. #September11
Every #September11 reopens wounds anew for families of those lost and for the children of 9/11 who grew up without ever knowing a parent.
It has been 15 years since the horrific attacks of #September11. We remember the families across this great nation who still mourn.

You can see a summary of intel gained on pages 96 and 97 of the Minority View: http://t.co/acRtW96qqD
The intelligence gained from the program helped us identify and capture important al-Qa’ida terrorists and disrupt their ongoing plotting.
Bottom line: the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program developed significant intelligence. http://t.co/acRtW96qqD
On this recent report: “The Senate's Intelligence Committee staff chose to interview no one.” http://t.co/z4FUyuU6tI
“This comm. departed from that high road &amp; slipped into the same partisan mode that marks most of what happens on Capitol Hill these days.”

"Sen. Kerrey, who served on the Intel Committee for 8 years, wrote in USA Today abt his thoughts on the Intel report: http://t.co/z4FUyuU6tI"

The Minority Views are not a minority report–the minority did not actively participate in the Study.  http://t.co/h6Gew2mcYt

I urge everyone to read the Minority Views which document many falsehoods propagated by the Study: http://t.co/h6Gew2mcYt
It is regrettable that the Comm’s Dems decided to put their own political agenda before the safety &amp; security of our nation &amp; our allies.
I fear the ramifications for our national security and I stand by my assertion that this report is flawed. http://t.co/Ejjm8tg7GV

"Filibustering such a bill is not only the height of hypocrisy, but also lays bare for the world the hollowness of this so-called strategy."
I voted today to advance the exact bill that a handful of my colleagues asked for.
"March 22, 2013 I voted with @SenTedCruz to repeal and replace #Obamacare and @SenatorCrapo to repeal Obamacare's middle-class tax hikes."
"This year I voted for @SenatorHatch’s amdt to repeal the medical device tax, which I discussed last evening: http://t.co/LxU1gcRiBT"
On 04/14/11 the first concurrent resolution to defund #Obamacare was offered -- Senate Dems chose to continue funding.
"April 2011, another vote to repeal the 1099 reporting requirement."
"In February of 2011, I supported @McConnellPress in his amendment to repeal #Obamacare – it was voted down by Senate Dems."
We voted to repeal 1099 reporting requirements.
"Since final passage, GOPs have continually voted against #Obamacare. In 2010 we voted to repeal HHS regulation on grandfathered plans."
"Finally, I joined all of my fellow Republicans to OPPOSE final passage of #Obamacare."
I fought every one of @SenatorReid’s procedural tactics to move #Obamacare forward on the Senate floor.
"Once brought to the floor, my colleagues and I raised two points of order challenging the constitutionality of #Obamacare."
"In the Finance Committee, I fought Dems effort to raise taxes on the middle class. #Obamacare"
"Moving into December, I voted for the Gregg amdt to keep Senate Dems from raiding Medicare to fund #Obamacare."
The fight against #Obamacare moved to the Finance Committee where I voted to strike Medicare &amp; Medicare Advantage cuts &amp; home health cuts.
Mikulski offered the contraception mandate again and again I voted NO.
"On the 15th of July, the HELP Committee wanted to report #Obamacare to the floor which I strongly voiced my opposition."
"On July 14, 2009, @TomCoburn offered a substitute to #Obamacare – the Patient’s Choice Act – a piece we that we wrote together."
"Realizing it would destroy businesses, @SenatorHatch offered amdt to terminate employer mandate if it lowered wages or caused job loss."
I offered another amendment to provide no funding to #Obamacare unless Medicare is solvent.
".@SenatorBarb then offered the contraception mandate, which all @GOPHELP members voted AGAINST."
"Together, @TomCoburn and I offered admts that would have struck the employer mandate &amp; any government-run insurance plans."
"Because @SenAlexander’s earlier amdt failed due to HELP Dems, @TomCoburn offered another admt to strike Medicaid expansion."
"I offered an amendment that would keep insurance provisions from taking effect if they increased costs. Unsurprisingly, Dems defeated it."
.@SenatorEnzi’s amdt would've capped growth of #Obamacare premium subsidies and would eliminate subsidies for people over a certain income.
"We also voted for Roberts’ amdt to strike tax hikes, Medicare cuts, and employer penalties."
"At the start of July in ’09 a multitude of admts were offered by GOPs on HELP, including @SenAlexander’s amdt to strike Medicaid expansion."
"The next day, I supported @TomCoburn’s admt to prevent the addition of new bureaucrats at HHS. #wastefulspending"
"On 6/23/09, I voted to block a new #Obamacare Public Health Fund, an amdt offered by @SenatorHarkin."
"Attempting to stop progress, I voted yes on 6/18/09 to Gregg amdt that would provide NO funding until there was a GAO study of costs."
"When the debate #Obamacare began, my fellow GOPs and I on HELP committee stood together on countless amdts to stop it from moving forward."
"I have voted 56 times to kill, repeal, dismantle, &amp; defund #Obamacare. I will continue to fight to get rid of this #trainwreck"
