PRESS RELEASE: Roberts: Hold Remains Absent White House Assurance Not to Send #GITMO Terrorists to Kansas https://t.co/l7BcxEWsXc
ICYMI here is my speech on the Fanning nom &amp; WH refusal to assure me no terrorists from #GITMO will be sent to KS. https://t.co/LFpL5qXRfr
"If the plans from the administration rule out Ft. Leavenworth as an option for the relocation of #GITMO, all they have to do is tell me."
"But make no mistake, I remain adamantly opposed to placing #GITMO detainees anywhere on the U.S. mainland."
It is what Kansans expect and have demanded of me.
This hold is one of the tools afforded to me as a US Senator &amp; I will do everything in my power to protect the national security of the U.S.
All I am asking is for the @WhiteHouse to assure me Ft. Leavenworth is NOT a viable alternative.
I have reviewed the latest assessment &amp; it's apparent that it’s virtually impossible to safely relocate terrorists to Ft. Leavenworth
"The admin. refused to come forward w/ a real plan to re-locate the prisoners, instead of a weak attempt to honor a campaign promise."
We should be angry at the @WhiteHouse that intends to ignore laws &amp; wants to bring terrorists to our shores.
"w/ the threat of executive order, I have little choice but to do what I can to block the transfer of #GITMO detainees to Ft. Leavenworth."
"After much study &amp; review, I can name you countless reasons why this plan is wrong. It is also illegal, which @POTUS' cabinet acknowledges."
"He insists on transferring the remaining #GITMO detainees to a site on the US the mainland, w/ Ft. Leavenworth under serious consideration."
"As I have publicly stated from the beginning, my issue is not w/ the nominee, but w/ POTUS who continues to insist on closing #GITMO this yr"
It is my deep respect &amp; concern for our men &amp; women in uniform &amp; all those at Ft. Leavenworth that has compelled me to hold @POTUS' nominee.
I support Fanning to be Secretary of the @USArmy. KS is the proud home to 2 Army posts &amp;I want the Army to have a highly-qualified Secretary
SPEAKING NOW on the floor on the Fanning nomination &amp; @POTUS’ plan to close #GITMO &amp; bring terrorists to the mainland.

PRESS RELEASE: Senator Roberts’ Bill Blocks Proposed #IRS Rule Threatening Privacy &amp; Security of Charitable Donors https://t.co/mfbCJV8hrn
My legislation would block this proposed #IRS regulation to protect those taxpayers who give their money to those in need.
The #IRS proposal opens the door for scam artists to easily obtain social security information of these donors. This is a serious problem.
I'm alarmed that the #IRS now wants more information from charitable donors. Can we really trust the IRS can keep this information safe?
Heading to the floor to speak on my bill to protect the #IRS's latest target: charitable donors. Watch live at 5 ET: https://t.co/uInhsEgvky
