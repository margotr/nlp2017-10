You wouldn't agree to buy a car without knowing the price. Why would you with your health care? we need price transparency #wphealthcare
"CT scans can cost $250-$2500 depending on where you go, but you have no way of knowing. Our plan creates price transparency #wphealthcare"
Confident that @RepTomPrice will do a great job as HHS secretary to institute health care reform that works for patients. #wphealthcare
Congress should give Americans hope for a better vision of healthcare that will work for them. #wphealthcare
Obamacare has left 30 million uninsured. Republican alternative will insure more w/ better care. #wphealthcare
A fraction of Obamacare Medicaid funds actually reaches the patients. What a waste. #wphealthcare
"Why should states, with massive premium increases be forced to keep #Obamacare , a system that is failing them? #wphealthcare"
"Republicans have said, ""if you like your plan, you can keep it."" We mean it #wphealthcare"
Worked for 30 years in a hospital for the uninsured. These are my patients. Need a plan that gives them the power of choice. #wphealtchare
Obamacare forces Americans to pay more for benefits that they don't need. That needs to change. @wphealthcare

Good conversation and debate this morning. Lots of good thoughts and ideas shared about how to reform Medicaid. https://t.co/GJPt7h6pbC
"Medicaid helps poorer individuals but right now money is not used efficiently-too much going to institutions, not to help patients #HCReform"
#Medicaid has poor outcomes. Patients need provider accountability. #ProHC reform
We have to go past the anecdote and look at the data: patients only receive 20-40 cents of value for every $1 spent by the government #ProHC
Medicaid is the illusion of coverage without the power of access.
".@rebakahgeeMD agrees, Medicaid spends too much on institutions and not enough on patients"
Expanding Medicaid and not seeing improvement in the service shows a problem with the program. Spending more money with no result #ProHC

Revenue sharing allows states to maintain and prepare for infrastructure demands of energy production &amp; help protects our natural resources.
Did you know a fourth of America's energy supply depends on the support facilities in South LA? With development comes costs to our state.
"In LA, 100% of revenue from revenue sharing goes to coastal restoration projects--critical to LA survival and American energy security."
Energy-producing states deserve to share the revenue derived from energy developed both onshore and offshore.
.@SenBillNelson read the revenue sharing amendment. https://t.co/At5TH7SSzX
Big thanks to @lisamurkowski @DavidVitter @MarkWarner @timkaine @SenatorTimScott @ThomTillis for sponsoring revenue sharing amendment.

Heard in @EnergyGOP hearing: U.S. exporting crude oil is a clear win.
Read the data and see more here: https://t.co/G6NCB4HByE
"This will result in tons less GHG emissions, more income for American workers, an increase in the US GDP and a focus on American priorities."
"Bottom line, if crude oil export ban and American oil is exported, the demand for Iranian oil will decrease..."
"If Iran ups oil production by 2M barrels per day due to a vacuum US leaves in market, they will emit 100,000 metric tons more CO2e per day."
Rigs in the Gulf emit 0.031 &amp; 0.034 metric tons of CO2e per barrel-- Iranian oil fields emit 0.070 to 0.099 metric tons of CO2e per barrel.
Iran emits almost three times the GHG per barrel during production of crude oil than that of U.S. producers in the Gulf of Mexico.
"...While pushing the Iran deal, Obama failed to mention that Iran does not share U.S. commitment to reducing emissions from oil production."
Obama has repeatedly made clear his belief that no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.
...while his Iran agreement allows Iran to increase their oil production by 2 million barrels per day &amp; gives access to new global markets.
Obama has attempted to lower GHG emissions by limiting domestic oil and gas production on federal lands &amp; implements crude oil export ban...
