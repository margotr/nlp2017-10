Happy to see @POTUS admin. nominate Matthew D. Kruger for US Attorney in eastern WI. He has extensive experience &amp; will serve admirably.
A YES vote on GCHJ is a victory for federalism and helps put states and individuals back in charge of their health care decisions.
A NO vote on GCHJ leaves 100% of Obamacare in place and America on path to single-payer health care.  Conservatives can't let that happen.
