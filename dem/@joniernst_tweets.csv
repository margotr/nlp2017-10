"I won’t stop until we repeal ObamaCare and find affordable, patient-centered healthcare solutions for all Americans. You have my word."
"My commitment to you remains the same, however. We MUST continue to work for those who have been negatively impacted by ObamaCare."
And to say I’m disappointed that my colleagues in the Senate chose this unsustainable status quo would be an understatement.
"Unfortunately, all three of those votes failed."
"Over the last few days, I’ve voted three times to repeal ObamaCare, just like I promised you."
We can’t give up.
"In the days ahead, as the Senate moves forward and considers various options, I will continue to make your voice heard in Washington."
That’s why I voted to begin debate on repealing this disastrous law and replacing it with solutions that are patient-centered.
"For far too long, I’ve heard from folks about the struggles everyday Americans face under ObamaCare."
"Wishing my friend, and American hero, John McCain the very best. Our thoughts and prayers are with you."
