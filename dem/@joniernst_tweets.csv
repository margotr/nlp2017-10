"I won’t stop until we repeal ObamaCare and find affordable, patient-centered healthcare solutions for all Americans. You have my word."
"My commitment to you remains the same, however. We MUST continue to work for those who have been negatively impacted by ObamaCare."
And to say I’m disappointed that my colleagues in the Senate chose this unsustainable status quo would be an understatement.
"Unfortunately, all three of those votes failed."
"Over the last few days, I’ve voted three times to repeal ObamaCare, just like I promised you."
We can’t give up.
"In the days ahead, as the Senate moves forward and considers various options, I will continue to make your voice heard in Washington."
That’s why I voted to begin debate on repealing this disastrous law and replacing it with solutions that are patient-centered.
"For far too long, I’ve heard from folks about the struggles everyday Americans face under ObamaCare."
"Wishing my friend, and American hero, John McCain the very best. Our thoughts and prayers are with you."

Tonight President Obama delivered his #SOTU address &amp; all we heard was more election year rhetoric. Hear my thoughts: http://t.co/8DQc5kza3V
"What we really need to do in order to get our great nation back on track is more freedom, more opportunity &amp; less government. #SOTU #IASEN"
"Yes, we owe a lot to our troops and must take care of our veterans. Proud to have served with so many of them. #SOTU #IASen"
What about the broken promises of being able to keep your insurance? #Obamacare #BraleysObamacare #SOTU #IASen
"As a mother, I don't believe gov will create opportunity for me or my daughter - the free market will. #SOTU"
Keep waiting for POTUS to talk about #obamacare #SOTU
Not good policy RT @StewSays: POTUS calls for a tax hike on energy producers. #SOTU
"We need real, proven solutions,such as tax cuts,that put more money directly back into the hands of our families &amp; lead to more jobs. #SOTU"
"According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are still nearly 1.2M fewer jobs today than 6 yrs ago. #SOTU #iasen"
"Gov't is over $17 trillion in debt, more than $6 trillion added during POTUS 5 yrs  in office. We need a smaller, more efficient govt #SOTU"
Hoping for more substance and less political rhetoric tonight #SOTU #IASEN
Hope tonight the President will focus on true substance rather than election yr rhetoric #SOTU http://t.co/F3mIGVyyyI http://t.co/v3mBHFFIug
