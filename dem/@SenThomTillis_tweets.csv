Sanction relief from #IranDeal will give Iranian mullahs tens of billions they can use to fund their global terror network.
"Obama admin's move to sidestep the American people means even if Congress votes to block #IranDeal, sanction relief will still proceed."
The #IranDeal grants one costly concession after another and ignores 40 years of open hostility from the Iranian regime.
It's clear that President Obama never intended to allow Congress and the American people to have a voice on the #IranDeal.
The Obama admin has violated the public trust by rushing to the UN to lift Iran sanctions before seeking the approval of Congress.

My full statement on the Obama administration's bad deal with Iran: http://t.co/okc8pvpnYs #ncpol
Democrats &amp; Republicans share grave concerns over the bad #IranDeal &amp; Congress has a responsibility to do everything it can to stop it.
"The lasting legacy of the #IranDeal will be the birth of a nuclear arms race, plunging the Middle East into further chaos."
"List of concessions to Iran include: no snap inspections, no resolution of weaponization activities, no dismantling of Iran terror network."
The President turned his back on decades of assurances from previous administrations that Iran would not acquire nuclear weapons.
President Obama has staked his legacy on reaching a deal w/ Iran w/o any regard for how dangerous the final accord is for the world.
