President Obama said he wanted to work with Republicans; #KeystoneXL was an opportunity for a bipartisan accomplishment &amp; he walked away.
"The President refuses to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù to the infrastructure project itself. For six years, his answer has been ‚Äúwait.‚Äù #KeystoneXL"
This #Keystone issue is bigger than oil; it is a demonstration of an Executive that refuses to answer a simple pipeline permit request.
"Today‚Äôs #veto is further proof that POTUS is more focused on politics &amp; satisfying special interests, than the economy &amp; energy independence"
