Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe will testify before an open hearing of the Senate Intel Cmte tomorrow.
"His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the Bureau and the nation."
Dir. Comey has been more forthcoming w/ information than any FBI Director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intel committees.
"In my interactions w/ the Director and w/ the Bureau under his leadership, he &amp; the FBI have always been straightforward with our Committee."
His dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.
I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order.
I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey’s termination.

May God continue to bless America. #September11
"We are a nation of heroes, and today we have the opportunity to stand amongst them, to thank them, and to honor those lost."
We send our thoughts and prayers to those who are currently serving in the darkest and most hostile places on the planet.
Let us today remember those who lost their lives on 9/11 and those who have since made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
It is only together that we can successfully confront and defeat vile ideologies that seek to do us harm and destroy our way of life.
"Friends and allies around the world stand with us, and we must stand with them."
"The evil of ISIL and al-Qaida, and related and similar groups around the world, suffers no restraints except those that we impose upon it."
I can tell you that we are up to the challenge – as long as we do not forget the past. #September11
"Today is a day for remembrance, it must also be a day for refocusing: the threat to America and her allies is real and unrelenting."
"For our intelligence professionals, every day must be treated like September 12, 2001, with a constant refrain: ‘Never again’"
"They, too, have been working around the clock since the early hours after #September11."
"The intelligence professionals, military and civilian, who serve America do an incredible job."
"There are others in our nation’s service who are far less visible, yet equally worthy of our praise and admiration."
"These men and women, regardless of the color of the uniform they wear, are serving with honor to ensure we are secure at home."
"There are countless others who have heeded the call to duty, serving at home and abroad to keep an aggressive, resourceful enemy at bay."
"The 82nd Airborne, 2nd Marine Division, special operations forces, &amp; 4th Fighter Wing, are often called upon to be the first to fight."
"Many of those heroes hail from towns we are so familiar with: Fayetteville, Jacksonville, Cherry Point, Goldsboro"
"We cannot, and will not, forget. #September11"
"Thousands have returned from the battlefield with grievous injuries, and so many have made the ultimate sacrifice."
Our service members and their families continue to sacrifice on behalf of all of us. #September11
"Come October, they will have been at war for 15 years, taking the fight to the enemy so the enemy doesn’t bring the fight to our homes."
"Our military remains engaged with the enemy in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and in other parts of the world."
"In communities across our nation, first responders stand ready to put their lives on the line so that others might live."
"Our first responders, continue today as they did then: rushing toward the fire and the chaos, while most rush away."
We must also remember the sacrifices made by so many others since #September11.
I ask all of you to keep those families in your thoughts and prayers today. #September11
Every #September11 reopens wounds anew for families of those lost and for the children of 9/11 who grew up without ever knowing a parent.
It has been 15 years since the horrific attacks of #September11. We remember the families across this great nation who still mourn.
