Updated witness list for open Intel Cmte World Wide Threats Hearing hearing tomorrow https://t.co/FF96X7JKN8 https://t.co/mbHSiFzLjS
Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe will testify before an open hearing of the Senate Intel Cmte tomorrow.
"His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the Bureau and the nation."
Dir. Comey has been more forthcoming w/ information than any FBI Director I can recall in my tenure on the congressional intel committees.
"In my interactions w/ the Director and w/ the Bureau under his leadership, he &amp; the FBI have always been straightforward with our Committee."
His dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.
I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order.
I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey’s termination.
