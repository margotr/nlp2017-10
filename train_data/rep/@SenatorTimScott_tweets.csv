20. I’m also not going to stop looking for a solution – giving up isn’t what we were sent here to do.
19. I’m not going to give up on repealing the Unaffordable Care Act. American families deserve better.
"18. I truly believe we all want what’s best for our nation and her people. To me, that’s finding a better solution than the ACA provides."
17. But here’s what I’m not doing – I’m not going to impugn the intentions of people who disagree
16. You can’t just put your head in the sand and ignore those facts and hope that it lives forever
"15. Its price tag grew and grew from the billions into the trillions, and finally scoring agencies just gave up"
"14. The ACA is not sustainable, and hasn’t been from the beginning. Its foundation was built on certain groups that never signed up"
13. I remain committed to repealing the ACA and replacing it with a system that works for all families
"12. So that’s where we stand today. A bad program that has grown deep roots, and a bitterly divided political culture."
"11. We’ve got to realize that our pattern should not be disagree and destroy, but rather disagree and solve"
"10. And two – along the way we stopped fighting the policy, and started fighting the people behind it"
9. No matter how badly the program serves (or doesn’t serve) the people – replacing an entitlement is hard
"8. The ACA went into effect, and – “A government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth” (Reagan)"
7. Two things happened along the way to where we stand today
6. These are facts – you can’t argue with them. And that’s not how our health care system should work
"5. Not everyone got to keep their doctors, and they weren’t able to keep their plans"
"4. Millions are paying for insurance they don’t want. In SC, more than 100,000 stuck without an option"
"3. In South Carolina, we’re down to one insurer offering plans on the exchanges.We’re seeing triple digit premium hikes,sky high deductibles"

"It is a life long passion for me, and I am committed to working for ALL of our kids."
I want true reform that strengthens public education and gives parents a choice for their childrens’ future.
"So while some want to continue to put band-aids on a system that isn’t working for a lot of kids, I do not."
"Because without education, incarceration rates go up, unemployment goes up, lifetime earnings go down."
"We will work with Secretary DeVos to strengthen all of our schools, and to make sure quality education is available to all."
Let’s be clear-there are 1000s of low performing schools across this nation. You can hold the floor forever…but it won’t change that fact
The fact remains no Secretary of Education has the power to “destroy public schools” - and no one would.
"We need strong public schools, as well as strong options for parents to choose the best option for their kids."
"I am thankful for all the calls, for the passion we’ve seen about education policy for the past two weeks."

"6. There is amazing work being done in communities across our nation every day, but their efforts aren’t always recognized by policymakers."
"5. We’re engaging communities, learning about solutions from the ground up instead of trying force them from the top down."
4. We’ve brought together the #SenateOpportunityCoalition to help change that.
"3. We have created a poverty floor, but not the opportunities needed for every family in every community to find success."
"2. The solutions of the past 50 years, while well intentioned, simply have not gotten that job done."
