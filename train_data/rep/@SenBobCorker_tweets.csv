"Since it will be four years before the U.S. is officially out, @POTUS could work toward an agreement that could be ratified by the Senate."
"If the Paris agreement were so important to the future of the world, why was President Obama so unwilling to have it ratified as a treaty?"
No one should be surprised that one man deciding the fate of our country with the Paris climate agreement can easily be undone by one man.
"Unlike France and Germany, President Obama purposely chose not to have the Paris agreement ratified by the Senate."
The left's anger about the Paris climate agreement should be directed at President Obama.

The U.S. should absolutely veto the @UN Security Council resolution re: Israel. Anti-Israel bias only undermines peace efforts.
Our committee will carry out exactly the same procedures for Mr. Tillerson’s nomination that have been carried out for more than 10 years.
"That has always been the plan, it is already in progress, and I am deeply disappointed my colleagues continue to imply otherwise."
Mr. Tillerson will submit an extensive financial disclosure and will go through same ethics and FBI checks as previous nominees.
"By all accounts, Mr. Tillerson is currently ahead of schedule in providing information to the committee."
