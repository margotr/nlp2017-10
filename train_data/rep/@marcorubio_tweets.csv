Americans who travel to Cuba can stay &amp; spend with any non-military business on island. Now it's up to Castro govt. to allow them to benefit
"If Cuban people are hurt it will be because the Castro govt doesn't allow them to own their own business, not because of the new policy"
"The truth is for many supporters of Obama #Cuba policy it was about $ for them, even if it meant doing business with the Castro military."
I thought best thing about Obama #Cuba policy was help for private small biz?The #BetterDealforCuba helps them &amp; hurts the military monopoly
"But notice how U.S. opponents of #BetterDealforCuba avoid mentioning core of the policy, prohibition on doing business with Cuban military"
