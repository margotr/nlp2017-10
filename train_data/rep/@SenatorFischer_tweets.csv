The global turmoil of today highlights why the #NDAA bill before us is so important.
"We remain a nation at war, with thousands of men and women in uniform still deployed to the Middle East and Afghanistan."

At 1:50PM #AirForce1 landed at @Offutt_AFB with President George W Bush. For 2 hours @US_Stratcom was the center of U.S. nat‚Äôl defense
"As the day unfolded, @US_Stratcom received notice that the ‚Äúsecure location‚Äù the president would be using was @Offutt_AFB"
.@US_Stratcom worked to identify which planes had been hijacked &amp; monitored the landings of thousands of civilian aircraft.
"When the 2nd plane hit on 9/11, @US_Stratcom understood this was not a fictional threat: America was under attack"
The main purpose of the exercise was to test the military's command and control procedures in the event of nuclear warfare.
"On #September11th 2001, at @Offutt_AFB, @US_Stratcom staff woke up expecting to continue a training exercise"
Sixteen years after the terrorist attacks our nation unites once again to honor the Americans killed on that horrific day.

We must change our strategy to protect Americans. Secondary sanctions and enhanced #MissileDefense should form the basis of our approach.
Kim Jong-un has threatened to attack US cities w/ nuclear weapons. His capability to carry out this threat grows w every passing day
"‚Äúno good options‚Äù is frequently repeated when confronting the NK threat. This may be true, but the gravity of the situation demands action."
I plan to hold hearings in @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte to examine #administrations #MissileDefense review proposed way forward.
The #administration is conducting the first review of ballistic missile threats &amp; our missile defense posture since 2010 #MissileDefense
Deploying more interceptors would add capacity and enable our defenses to better handle ICBM threats #NorthKorea
Rate of NK‚Äôs technical progress demands response eg additional ground-based radars &amp; space-based sensors to impve ability to track threats
As chairman of @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte I work w #MissileDefenseAgency directors &amp; STRATCOM commanders to impve our #MissileDefense
We cannot rely on deterrence alone. We must ensure that our missile defense efforts stay ahead of #NorthKorea's accelerating developments.
The Chinese view #NorthKorea through a narrow lens of immediate strategic interest. That is how we must target our actions.
One thing is certain: the principle economic enablers of #NorthKorea are China and Russia.
NK ICBM developments reveal sophisticated program that is pursuing weapons designed for no other purpose than to threaten the U.S. &amp; allies
Last month NK conducted 2 ICBM tests. A number of reports say the 2nd test demonstrated sufficient range to reach much of the United States.
