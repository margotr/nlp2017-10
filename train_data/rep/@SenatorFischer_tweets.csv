"But, the #NDAA is more than just answering these threats. It‚Äôs about helping us here at home, too."
The global turmoil of today highlights why the #NDAA bill before us is so important.
"We remain a nation at war, with thousands of men and women in uniform still deployed to the Middle East and Afghanistan."

At 1:50PM #AirForce1 landed at @Offutt_AFB with President George W Bush. For 2 hours @US_Stratcom was the center of U.S. nat‚Äôl defense
"As the day unfolded, @US_Stratcom received notice that the ‚Äúsecure location‚Äù the president would be using was @Offutt_AFB"
.@US_Stratcom worked to identify which planes had been hijacked &amp; monitored the landings of thousands of civilian aircraft.
"When the 2nd plane hit on 9/11, @US_Stratcom understood this was not a fictional threat: America was under attack"
The main purpose of the exercise was to test the military's command and control procedures in the event of nuclear warfare.
"On #September11th 2001, at @Offutt_AFB, @US_Stratcom staff woke up expecting to continue a training exercise"
Sixteen years after the terrorist attacks our nation unites once again to honor the Americans killed on that horrific day.

We must change our strategy to protect Americans. Secondary sanctions and enhanced #MissileDefense should form the basis of our approach.
Kim Jong-un has threatened to attack US cities w/ nuclear weapons. His capability to carry out this threat grows w every passing day
"‚Äúno good options‚Äù is frequently repeated when confronting the NK threat. This may be true, but the gravity of the situation demands action."
I plan to hold hearings in @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte to examine #administrations #MissileDefense review proposed way forward.
The #administration is conducting the first review of ballistic missile threats &amp; our missile defense posture since 2010 #MissileDefense
Deploying more interceptors would add capacity and enable our defenses to better handle ICBM threats #NorthKorea
Rate of NK‚Äôs technical progress demands response eg additional ground-based radars &amp; space-based sensors to impve ability to track threats
As chairman of @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte I work w #MissileDefenseAgency directors &amp; STRATCOM commanders to impve our #MissileDefense
We cannot rely on deterrence alone. We must ensure that our missile defense efforts stay ahead of #NorthKorea's accelerating developments.
The Chinese view #NorthKorea through a narrow lens of immediate strategic interest. That is how we must target our actions.
One thing is certain: the principle economic enablers of #NorthKorea are China and Russia.
NK ICBM developments reveal sophisticated program that is pursuing weapons designed for no other purpose than to threaten the U.S. &amp; allies
Last month NK conducted 2 ICBM tests. A number of reports say the 2nd test demonstrated sufficient range to reach much of the United States.

"Corporal Alexander was laid to rest on May 18, 2007 in Nebraska. Over 1500 people attended to say their final goodbyes."
"On May 6th Matthew spoke to his mother &amp; Kara for the last time. A few days later an IED detonated near him, killing him instantly."
"When Mathew returned to Baqubah, Iraq his unit encountered fierce fighting likened to the close-quarters combat of #Vietnam."
"He returned home from combat and in February of 2007 married his childhood sweetheart, Kara, on Valentine‚Äôs Day."
"Matthew‚Äôs unit deployed to Mosul, Iraq where they assisted with the training of the Iraqi militia #OperationIraqiFreedom"
Matthew enlisted in the Army shortly before graduating from Gretna High School in May of 2004 and shipped off to Basic Training that summer

Bill Bailey is a true Nebraska hero. I am honored to tell his story. #NEHeroes #ProudNebraskan
"Bill was a wonderful husband, brother, son, father. He dedicated quite a bit of his life to helping other people. #NEHeroes"
"Specialist Bailey earned several military awards including the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Iraqi Campaign Medal &amp; Combat Action Badge. #Honor"
More than one thousand people gathered in Bellevue to remember Bill. #NEHeroes
"On May 25, 2007, during a security escort mission, Bill‚Äôs vehicle struck an improvised explosive device. Bill Bailey was killed. #NEHeroes"
"By 2007, the insurgency in Iraq had erupted to new levels of violence. Increased American forces sought to destroy the al Qaeda network."
"In 2006, his unit was deployed and assigned to provide security escorts for truck convoys operating out of Balad Air Base in #Iraq."
"That deep desire to serve the country continued to tug at him. In 2005, Bill re-enlisted in the @NENationalGuard #Courage"
Bill‚Äôs protective nature made him a great father. It also made him a great firefighter. #NeHeroes
"After 9/11, Bill felt the call to serve his country again. But, first things first. Bill and Dee married in 2004."
"In December 2000, Bill met Dee. She was a bank teller at Wells Fargo; he drove an armored truck. They met through a service window."
Bill attended Bellevue East where the call to protect his country prompted him to enlist in the @NENationalGuard in 1995.

Let‚Äôs take advantage of this moment when we have common ground on a commonsense and straightforward legislation for #EqualPay #Bipartisan
Most importantly this bill is possible: 53 Republican and 5 Dem Senators supported a version of the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct last Congress.
Many congressional Democrats requested and even praised an Obama executive order with similar language to my proposal #EqualPay
"Importantly for employers, the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct wouldn't impose new federal regulations or mandates"
"With this flexibility, women can better negotiate arrangements that make sense for them. #Flexibility"
"When employees, especially women, have more information, they can confidently pursue favorable work and wage arrangements #KnowledgeIsPower"
A culture of silence and fear of retaliation can keep people in the dark about how their wages compare to others‚Äô #KnowledgeIsPower
The #WorkplaceAdvancementAct would empower women with info about wages so they can be informed advocates for themselves.
I‚Äôve reintro‚Äôd the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct based on a simple idea: equal pay through empowerment #KnowledgeIsPower https://t.co/4ifgWsmas9

The #DIGITAct is a bipartisan bill. Both parties understand the need to position the US as a #IoT world leader.
The #DIGITAct will bring together a working group of federal agencies &amp; private sector stakeholders to develop #IoT

Germaine Debro was promoted posthumously to the rank of sergeant. #NEheroes
"On September 18, 2006, the Morning Star Baptist Church near downtown Omaha was filled with people paying a final tribute to Sgt. Debro."
"Sergeant Josiah Warren, riding in the right seat, tried unsuccessfully to pull Germaine free. Sgt. Debro died on 9/4/06"
"Thirty miles outside Baghdad, Germaine‚Äôs Humvee struck an improvised explosive device."
"On September 4, 2006, a 20-truck convoy headed out from a site 30 miles north of Baghdad."
Germaine‚Äôs unit was right in the thick of it. Enemy attacks were frequent. Tensions were high.
"After a year of training, the First of the 167th Cavalry arrived in Iraq in early 2006. That‚Äôs when the Sunni-Shia civil war erupted."
"In 2005, Germaine learned his unit, the First of the 167th Cavalry of the @NEnationalGuard, would deploy to Iraq."
Germaine deployed to Kuwait in 2001 and to Bosnia in 2002. #ProudNebraskan #NEheroes
