"I applaud the President for his excellent choice, and I look forward to enthusiastically working toward Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation."
This vacancy was a central to 2016 campaign &amp; the people have spoken by electing President Trump and returning a Republican Senate majority.
"Judge Gorsuch is a judge’s judge, who is well within the mainstream and always decides cases based on what the law says."
Judge Gorsuch's opinions are well-reasoned &amp; brilliantly written. He has enriched the Tenth Circuit’s jurisprudence in a number of areas.
"Judge Gorsuch is a prepared, thoughtful, and careful jurist, who has demonstrated a strong commitment to textualism and originalism."
I’ve had the privilege of arguing before Judge Gorsuch and he is extremely impressive.

Senate doesn't need to eliminate filibuster. Better solution is to work more than 3 days per week. Allow time for debate and deliberation.
"The real problem in the Senate isn't the filibuster. What we really need is for Senate to be the Senate: an open, deliberative body."
"What a healthy Senate lacks in efficiency, it makes up for with open, robust deliberation."
"The filibuster is about leverage, and that leverage is essential to maintaining equality and engendering deliberation among Senators."
Everything in the Senate is rooted in occupational equality of all Senators - filibuster protects this.
"The Senate is broken, but the filibuster has almost nothing to do with it."
