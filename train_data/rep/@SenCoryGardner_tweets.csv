I hope a future Administration reverses this dangerous course &amp; puts the Iranian regime under pressure necessary to truly change behavior.
"Iran has funded terror. Iran will continue to fund terror. Now, however, they have billions more to do it with."
Soleimani is responsible for supplying IEDs to Iraqi insurgents to kill Americans.
"Notably, Iran recently violated U.N. travel restrictions by sending abroad Qassem Soleimani, a known terrorist &amp; Iranian General."
"Just since this deal was announced, Iran has conducted multiple illegal ballistic missile tests. They've held American sailors at gunpoint."
The Administration seems convinced that endless concessions to Iran will provoke a behavior change. That has proven to be laughably false.
Groups funded by Iran have killed innocents in Syria. They've killed Israelis. They've killed Americans.
Many of us warned money released to the Iranian regime would fund terror. Sec. Kerry has now admitted as much. https://t.co/Am0OLTkMW2
