"10/ If Democrats won't allow Judge Gorusch a vote, they won’t allow anyone a vote. #ConfirmGorsuch"
"9/ Even Justice Clarence Thomas, who was confirmed 52-48, a razor thin margin, was not filibustered on the Senate floor."
8/ I agree w/@marcthiessen who wrote in @WashingtonPost “the idea that Gorsuch should be the first [filibustered] is patently absurd.”
7/ @PittsburghPG is right: “Democrats… should accept reality… they’d end up losing a battle to kill his nomination.”
6/ @NYTimes reports “There has never been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee.” Dems wrong to start now.
"5/ While @SenSanders falsely claims there is a 60-vote standard, @GlennKesslerWP awards #ThreePinocchios: https://t.co/UIWWOKhQd8"
"4 /In a historically unprecedented move, many of my Democratic colleagues have decided to filibuster Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation."
