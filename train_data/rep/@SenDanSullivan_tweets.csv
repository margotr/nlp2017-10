"The Rebuild America Now Act would prevent billions from being wasted in red tape/litigation, make it easier to overhaul U.S. infrastructure."
"My bill will include a builder's &amp; worker's bill of rights, requiring timely permitting decisions, and transparency from federal agencies."
"Rebuild America Now Act would limit sue-and-settle practices used by radical groups to abuse the judicial system, delay projects to death."
This simple one-in one-out rule on federal regulations has been successfully implemented in the UK and Canada. #RegulationNation
"My bill would also cap regulations, requiring old regs to be eliminated for every new reg enacted by a federal agency (RED Tape Act)."
"Rebuild America Now Act would (2) create 1-stop shop for environmental reviews, ensuring projects don't get bogged down by endless agencies."
"In new Congress, I will introduce the Rebuild America Now Act - (1) establishes time limits for approval/denial of permits for good cause."
President-elect @realDonaldTrump is set to reverse Obama Admin's abysmal permitting record. Members of Congress should join this effort.
"Labor leader Terry O'Sullivan, with @LIUNA, called Pres. Obama's actions a “cynical manipulation of the approval process.” #RegulationNation"
#KeystoneXL languished in permitting purgatory for two Obama terms before the President finally killed it in 2015. #RegulationNation
"Obama Admin's capricious permitting was part of why @Shell halted its #Alaska operations, stranding resources and killing 1000s of jobs."
