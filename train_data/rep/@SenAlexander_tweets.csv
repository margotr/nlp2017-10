I look forward to hearing how the administration is moving this important work forward.
Congress passed CARA &amp; #21stCenturyCures in a bipar way to provide funding &amp; update pgrms to assist states &amp; help combat the opioid crisis.
And about what policies FDA has put in place to make sure that the opioid alternatives submitted to FDA are prioritized appropriately (2/2)
I want to hear today about the public-private partnership that NIH is leading (1/2)
The most ambitious goal of #21stCenturyCures was to drive research discoveries predicted by @NIHDirector including non-addictive painkillers
I hope today’s panel of witnesses can give this committee an update on the federal response to the crisis – what’s working &amp; what needs work
"This is a crisis. Not just in Tennessee, but across the country."
"Last yr., 1,631 Tennesseans died of drug overdose--12% more than the yr. before--mostly due to an increase in overdoses of synthetic opioids"
The amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S. in 2015 was enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for three weeks
"The opioid crisis is tearing our communities &amp; families apart, &amp; posing an enormous challenge to health care providers and law enforcement"
