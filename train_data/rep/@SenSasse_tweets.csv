"If you think 18 yrs sounds far off for #SocialSecurity's insolvency, ask a mom whose child just graduated high school how quickly that goes."
The SSA says we have 18 years until #SocialSecurity’s reserves dry up. This report indicates we have even less time than that.
The SSA is a black box: only the #SocialSecurity trustees (not even Congress!) know the real data or the methodologies used.
"What's more: the SSA doesn’t publish its data, so this new study can’t give us a number of how off our #SocialSecurity estimates might be."
"Essentially, we’ve had fewer babies &amp; fewer funerals than SSA estimated, which gives a very different picture of #SocialSecurity solvency."
"Since 2000, #SocialSecurity forecasts showed a rosier picture to Congress, providing false comfort &amp; misleading by a wider margin each year."
Their new Harvard-Dartmouth study checked the accuracy of ~30 years of #SocialSecurity forecasts &amp; it might be worse than we thought.
Kudos to @kinggary @kostyakashin &amp; Dr Soneji for an important analysis. We need to know the hard facts about #SocialSecurity’s health.
