It is a deep disservice to Puerto Ricans for the difficult questions being asked of federal relief agencies to continue to go unanswered.
"HHS and CDC must prioritize disease control, prevention, and treatment - to prevent worsening of crisis and allow Puerto Rico to recover."
"Without rapid action to prevent epidemics &amp; stop spread of diseases, treating sick Puerto Ricans will burden an already stressed system."
Americans deserve to know what CDC and HHS are doing to address faltering Puerto Rico response and forestall unprecedented illness &amp; death.
More than 1/3 of Puerto Rico lacks clean water. Infectious diseases are spreading. Americans are drinking water from hazardous waste sites.
"Nearly a month after Maria, Puerto Rico is teetering toward a terrifying collapse with deadly consequences. We cannot turn a blind eye."
@FCC The FCC must reassure Americans that it will not be bullied by the President into abandoning our core First Amendment freedoms.
"I am urging all @FCC commissioners to stand up for our free press and reject Pres. Trump's unacceptable, un-American threats."
Pres. Trump's recent calls to revoke broadcaster FCC licenses based on speech content are an affront to First Amendment &amp; American values.
"A robust, free press is the cornerstone of our democracy – ensuring public access to news without government meddling or censorship."

Congress must act immediately to spare Americans from the devastating impact of Trump’s horrific healthcare sabotage.
"Disgraceful that Pres. Trump is undercutting Americans' healthcare in service of misguided, myopic crusade against ACA. Not leadership."
"Brazen and baffling – Trump’s ending of ACA subsidies means higher premiums, destabilized markets, and pain for working families."
"ACA is law of the land. President Trump should work w/ both parties on improvements, instead of using regular Americans as political pawns."
I urge @DHSGov Inspector Gen. to quickly investigate Trump Admin handling of Puerto Rico relief. No excuse for self-promotion &amp; subterfuge.
"We need full truth about situation in Puerto Rico, not self-promotional videos that sugarcoat catastrophic crisis on the ground."
Americans need to know whether the Trump Administration is truly focused on helping millions of citizens suffering in Puerto Rico.
Congress must rescue health care from Trump sabotage. Onward Sens. Alexander &amp; Murray. Bipartisan work is our only hope.
"Mean-spirited, rash, irrational - Trump's ending critical ACA subsidies shreds health care protections and shatters promises."
Trump's sabotage of ACA seems boundless - a health care tragedy unfolding for countless Americans.
Must do much more to hold Iran accountable for other malign actions. President has failed to do so. This misstep will make that even harder.
Nothing changed since President twice notified Congress that preventing a nuclear-armed Iran through agreement was in our national interest.
Failure to certify Iran Agreement today undermines America’s credibility with allies and jeopardizes ability to hold Iran accountable.
"After emergency relief and rescue, we need long-term Marshall plan crafted by disaster relief czar partnering w/ Puerto Rican leaders."
Fellow Americans are dying. The island is devastated. Federal efforts are grossly inadequate. A disaster relief czar must take charge.
"Humanitarian crisis, calamity &amp; chaos in Puerto Rico are why I'm demanding a disaster relief czar - to cut through red tape &amp; deliver help."
RT @washingtonpost: The Post's Editorial Board: The misery in Puerto Rico is completely unacceptable https://t.co/o9dTJEBtdp
Disaster relief czar – appointed by President – vitally necessary to mobilize immediate aid and organize long-term recovery efforts.
We cannot tolerate double standard of disaster relief. Puerto Rico needs capable federal response to deepening humanitarian crisis.
"We need disaster relief czar to cut through red tape, work with local leaders, and ensure Puerto Ricans receive essential supplies."
Puerto Rico deserves a disaster relief czar to coordinate federal response - on the verge of failing millions of fellow Americans.

"Americans spoke loud and clear: We should strengthen the ACA, not sabotage it. Pres. Trump should listen to them instead of the far right."
"Trump owes us a concerted, bipartisan effort to bolster healthcare system - not a scheme that promises more coverage but delivers far less."
"The Trump admin will stop at nothing to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, no matter how many Americans are hurt. https://t.co/2n9Pgf0Elg"
Trump's threats to cease active aid for Puerto Rico reflect a double standard of disaster relief. America is about to fail fellow Americans.
"I saw a Puerto Rico struggling w devastation&amp;death in dire need of FEMA, military&amp;federal relief. Mr. President, it's a humanitarian crisis."
Abandoning Puerto Rico now by withdrawing FEMA would be a betrayal of fellow Americans.
Congress must provide aid for the millions of Puerto Rican people Trump seems intent on leaving behind.

Americans overwhelmingly want to help DREAMers. My GOP colleagues should reject White House divisiveness &amp; join Democrats to pass DREAM Act.
We must end the cruel chaos that Trump’s #DACA decision has sown - and act now to keep our promise to DREAMers.
Trump admin’s list of immigration demands is a slap in the face to DREAMers and an affront to the values that make America great.
We need better coordination – and robust long-term plan – to ensure Puerto Rico gets back on its feet and can rebuild stronger than before.
"If essentials delivery is failing, investigation should be federal, not just local, by FEMA Inspector General &amp; DOJ prosecutors if needed."
My constituents are right to ask: Why aren't loved ones in Puerto Rico getting the supplies they need? How long must they wait?
"In third week of humanitarian crisis, essential supply shortages continue to put American lives at risk. Unacceptable and unconscionable."
Delivery disconnect seems seriously widespread - as I heard in #Hartford today from families who have just arrived from Puerto Rico.

Repealing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act will unlock the doors of justice and give gun violence victims their day in court.
