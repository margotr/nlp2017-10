"Recently, @CFPB finalized payday lending rule, to rein in predatory payday loans that often keep working people trapped in a cycle of debt."
These payday lenders saddle borrowers with triple-digit interest rates &amp; cost Ohioans over $500 million/year in fees alone.
Why did Ohio try to cap these rates? Shady payday lenders have only their own interests at heart.
Ohio has the highest payday loan prices in the US - despite the fact that almost 2/3 of Ohioans voted to cap payday loan rates.

"@cbo We cannot let politicians in Washington, with taxpayer-funded healthcare, pull the rug out from under Ohio families and communities."
@cbo And #GrahamCassidy allows insurance companies to charge Ohioans age 50 and older more for their insurance.
"According @CBO, the House GOP plan - nearly identical to #GrahamCassidy - would cause premiums to go up an average of about 20% next year."
"And whether or not you're on Medicaid, you're looking at a premium increase next year if #GrahamCassidy becomes law."
As well as the 3 in 5 nursing home residents in Ohio who rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of their care.
"Also hurt: 71,000 veterans in Ohio who get their coverage through Medicaid, and 150,000 Ohioans getting opioid treatment."
"So who gets hurt by these Medicaid cuts?
To start: 973,000 children in Ohio who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance"
"It cuts a net $20 BILLION from Ohio. For every $1 OH spends on Medicaid on average, 63¬¢ comes from federal $ that #GrahamCassidy would cut."

My concern isn‚Äôt whether today‚Äôs nominees have a great deal of experience working for banks. They do.
Mr. Quarles bemoaned the role of ‚Äúthe government‚Äù as a ‚Äúplayer in the financial sector‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúreferee.‚Äù
"Mr. Otting‚Äôs bank made money by kicking seniors out of their homes, and then turned around and said the government made them do it."
It was an opportunity to profit by flipping failing banks bought at low prices &amp; foreclosing on working fams‚Äìall while raking in taxpayer $.
"But for wealthy bank executives and private equity investors, the crisis wasn‚Äôt a life-changing event."
"The financial crisis devastated the Ohio families that lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings."
Banks were not ‚Äúwell capitalized.‚Äù Taxpayers paid billions to bail those banks out while Quarles &amp; his co turned a profit off of the crisis.
"Contrary to Quarles‚Äôs predictions in 06, the economy was not ‚Äústrong,‚Äù the financial sector was not ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù &amp; our future was not ‚Äúbright.‚Äù"
But many of his stmts from then lead me to wonder whether he was asleep at the switch or willfully turning a blind eye to Wall St abuses.

So what is a pre-existing condition? Let's put it like this - you may pay more for healthcare under their plan if you've been affected by:
