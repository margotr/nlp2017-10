Wonder why the @GOP tax plan shovels money to billionaires while raising taxes for millions of working families? https://t.co/Z98pze6iR6
"If @realDonaldTrump won't reverse his birth control decision, Congress should make him. Read my @glamourmag op-ed. 
https://t.co/IHsChwnFVV"
.@realDonaldTrump's attack on the ACA's birth control mandate not only attacked reproductive rights. It attacked women's economic freedom.
"Responsible nations stick to their agreements. Responsible Presidents put America's safety first. If this President won't, Congress must."
Secretary Mattis said it’s good for our national security to stay in the #Irandeal. Chairman Dunford said Iran was complying with the terms.
"The #Irandeal is keeping Iran’s nuclear program under tough limits &amp; inspections. So far, it’s working to keep Iran away from a nuke."
The President’s outrageous decision to decertify isolates the US from our allies &amp; increases the risk that Iran gets a nuclear bomb.
Congress should act to stop @realDonaldTrump from following through on his threat to burn our health insurance system to the ground.
GOP &amp; Dem governors have urged Congress to keep our promise to families &amp; hold down health insurance premiums. We should listen to them.
"Cutting off payments that help low-income families afford health insurance is petty, cruel, &amp; just plain dumb."
Chairman @ChuckGrassley should reject @SenateMajLdr’s dangerous proposal to end blue slips &amp; stand up for fair courts &amp; equal justice.
".@SenateDems won’t sit silently while the rich &amp; powerful rig our courts &amp; ram through even more radical, right-wing, pro-corporate judges."
Now @SenateMajLdr wants to end the decades-long tradition of letting senators weigh in on home-state judicial noms. https://t.co/2qZSP9uCXO
".@SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP used every tool to stop fair, noncontroversial Obama judicial nominees from serving on federal courts."
Our federal govt must commit to helping the people of Puerto Rico &amp; the US Virgin Islands. US citizens deserve that much from their govt.
"Step up &amp; do your job, @realDonaldTrump. Stop lying about how well things are going in Puerto Rico. Stop trying to avoid responsibility."
"All along, @realDonaldTrump's response in Puerto Rico has been too little, too late. But he gives himself an ""A+."" Give me a break."
It is outrageous that @realDonaldTrump is making veiled threats to withdraw relief workers from US citizens in need. That's poor leadership.
Puerto Rico is still facing a humanitarian crisis. @realDonaldTrump seems more worried about blaming hurricane victims than helping them.

Now @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Administration are reportedly proposing NAFTA provisions that do nothing to bring back American jobs.
The Trump Administration has failed to get rid of ISDS - the corporate courts in NAFTA that give big businesses their own special rights.
"Despite promising to fix NAFTA's problems, @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Admin have failed to fight for workers through the first 3 rounds."
The fundamental problem with NAFTA is simple: the agreement doesn't work for American workers.
The American public deserve answers about what went wrong at @Equifax and what the company plans to do going forward.
"Former @Equifax CEO Smith, along with the new Chair &amp; interim CEO, should all testify before the Senate Banking Committee."
