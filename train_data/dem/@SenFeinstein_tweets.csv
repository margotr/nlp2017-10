We agree that civilians shouldn't have machine guns. We should agree on banning accessories that allow weapons to fire like machine guns.
A ban on bump fire stocks could have saved lives in Las Vegas by reducing the gunman's rate of fire. We MUST take action!

"38 senators support our bill to ban bump stocks. We're making progress, but we need your help. Urge Republican senators to support S.1916!"
Semi-automatic rifles fire between 45 and 60 rounds/minute. A bump stock increases the rate of fire to between 400 and 800 rounds/minute.
Bump fire stocks allow semi-automatic weapons to reach rates of fire of between 400 and 800 rounds PER MINUTE.
Las Vegas shooter outfitted 12 semi-automatic weapons w/ bump stocks. No law on the books would have stopped him from buying bump stocks.
FACT: Legislation is needed to ban bump stocks. This CAN’T be done through regulation.
Automatic weapons have been banned since 1986. Banning accessories that allow weapons to reach an automatic rate of fire is a no-brainer.
Technology like bump stocks has made the current definition of automatic weapons largely obsolete. That’s why we MUST update our laws.
