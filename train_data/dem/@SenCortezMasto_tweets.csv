"Big companies are trying to use fine print to silence Nevadans. We must protect consumers, students, &amp; our servicemembers' access to justice"
We can't let these big companies off the hook! The @CFPB's rule gives Main Street a fighting chance against the Big Banks &amp; seek justice.
"Since @Equifax breach of 143 million Americans' info, I've received nearly 4 dozen letters from Nevadans seeking justice."
"With at least 54,000 @WellsFargo fake accounts created in Nevada, it's more important than ever that consumers have protections from @CFPB."
"When we let Nevadans have their day in court, it puts another cop on the beat to ensure Big Banks can’t gouge borrowers w/ tricks &amp; traps."
"Whether it's fake accounts from @WellsFargo or @Equifax data breach, consumers need access to justice system &amp; have their day in court."
"The @CFPB issued a simple, straightforward rule that safeguards the right of every single American consumer to hold Big Banks accountable."
"In its short life, the @CFPB has returned $12 billion to 29 million consumers. In NV, the CFPB has worked to resolve about 14,600 cases."
"As NV's AG, I took on the Big Banks that preyed upon NV families, bringing back $1.9 billion to NV. Now, @CFPB looks out for consumers."
Fraud shouldn't be kept secret like in @WellsFargo scandal - American people need @CFPB rule so companies don't take advantage of consumers.
.@CFPB’s rule banning forced arbitration guarantees consumers their day in court to hold the worst companies accountable.

Senate GOP's repeal of the #ACA would result in premiums skyrocketing by 20-25% right away &amp; doubling by 2026. This is wrong for Nevada.
"Repealing #ACA will leave 18m people uninsured in a year, 32m in a decade. The Republicans are turning their backs on the American people."

Latinas have the highest rates of cervical cancer - one of the most preventable cancers. #ACA provides Latinas access to preventative care
Cuts to #Medicaid will have a severe impact on Latinas. 17m Latinas now have access to free preventative care. #ACA repeal would undo this.
