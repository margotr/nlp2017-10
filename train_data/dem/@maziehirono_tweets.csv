"Never ever be deterred by someone like @realdonaldtrump who doesn’t realize American ideals are bigger than any one man, any one President"
"To all of you who have spoken out- never, ever be deterred by those whose smallness incites them to label you ""Sad!"""
"The patience to understand change rarely comes quickly, yet with the urgency to never stop standing up, never stop speaking out"
"All an activist needs is an undying, unrelenting passion for America, faith in our shared ideals and what I call ""patient urgency"""
But you do not need to go to law school or serve in the Senate to be an activist.
"Today, I am a US Senator. An activist passionate as ever about America &amp; the ideals @realDonaldTrump does not understand"
