"#TrumpCare won't improve the quality of care for Americans or lower costs. ACA already works for millions. Let's improve it, not break it!"
Using #ACA anniversary as an arbitrary deadline to rush through #TrumpCare for symbolic reasons is ridiculous. GOP must take this seriously
#TrumpCare ends the #ACA #Medicaid expansion &amp; dismantles the program as we know it. Bad for millions of Americans who depend on #Medicaid
