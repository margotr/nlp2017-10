Americans must know the answers to these questions.  Nothing could be more in the public interest.
Testimony about whether the President tried to stop an investigation is not classified and must not be relegated to a closed session.
I'd say the hypocrisy is stunning. But I'm not surprised.

My letter to CBP asking for an explanation to ensure this doesn't happen again https://t.co/TNkLYh8CZO
"Glad to see the CBP has backed down, but it needs to explain how this abuse of power happened &amp; who is responsible https://t.co/8Boo3NI471?"
Our voices fighting against special interests are needed now more than ever. Don’t stop speaking out.
It’s as unsurprising as it is maddening for a party who claims to exalt individual liberties.
"Today, by confirming #Gorsuch, @SenateGOP sided with corporations &amp; the government over individual rights."
My statement on the recent events in Syria https://t.co/L9WMTkfCxU
#Gorsuch’s record is fraught with secret law &amp; favoring the powerful over the powerless. He should not be confirmed.
#Gorsuch fails to recognize that rights are reserved to the people. Not corporations or the government.
#Gorsuch’s failure to put the Constitution &amp; the law first disqualifies him from the Supreme Court.
"At the Department of Justice, #Gorsuch practiced secret law. He justified &amp; proposed government violations of the law prohibiting torture."
Gorsuch is locked in to an extreme right-wing viewpoint on death with dignity &amp; many other views.
Death with Dignity was passed to protect citizens private choices from government interference.
Gorsuch wrote an entire book attacking the right to make end-of-life choices like Oregon’s Death with Dignity law.
Gorsuch has demonstrated hostility toward the right of individuals to make decisions about their own lives w/out interference from the state
"Our Constitution is a document of constraints that limit the government, not the people."
Originalism = political agenda whose sole intent is reserving power for the powerful &amp; limiting recognition of rights reserved to the people
“Originalism” is a political agenda masquerading as a judicial philosophy.

Just one example: My Build America Bonds Act – part of the stimulus – financed over $180 billion in infrastructure projects
Trump’s claim the stimulus didn’t “build” anything is patently false https://t.co/wIPiFcukGk?

Earning less means less savings for retirement or for college. Unequal pay is wrong &amp; has far-reaching consequences  #EqualPayDay
Pay inequality is wrong &amp; it hurts economic security for women &amp; families. Passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct = big step fwd. #EqualPayDay

Bottom line: Americans want quality health care at affordable costs. That should be the priority over scoring political points.
"The Administration, through @SecPriceMD’s Health Department, will be responsible for costs and whether markets succeed or fail."
Important to watch in the days ahead: GOP is rooting for health care markets &amp; ACA to collapse.
24 million working Americans &amp; 110 million seniors &amp; low-income Americans can breathe easier for now. Your voices are making the difference.
