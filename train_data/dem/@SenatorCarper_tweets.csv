All Americans deserve that peace of mind. https://t.co/kMLuBX6vDF
Can House GOP explain why members of Congress are the only people entitled to protections for preexisting conditions under AHCA?
What we don‚Äôt know is the damage AHCA will have on middle class families and our economy because House GOP plan to vote without a CBO score.
"We know that AHCA puts Americans back at the mercy of insurance companies, which will choose who can get covered &amp; what that coverage costs."
We know that AHCA will kick more than 20 million Americans off their health insurance plans.
Happening soon in the Senate: a vote on a CRA that will make it harder for Americans to save for retirement. I'm voting NO. #SaveRetirement
