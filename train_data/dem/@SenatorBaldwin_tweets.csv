Or a disabled child who relies on Medicaid funding at school. Who would take health care away from a child?
A loved one who depends on Medicaid for nursing home care. They deserve better.
This will put everyone who depends on Medicaid at risk:
The Senate GOP repeal plan also cuts and caps Medicaid.
"Now, politicians in Madison will decide whether you keep the care you have - or whether it is taken away."
More bad news from the Senate GOP repeal plan: The guaranteed protections and care that you have today are weakened.
"If you have a pre-existing condition or struggle with a sickness, you could be thrown into a high-cost pool that prices you out of coverage."
"If you are older, you could pay an #AgeTax."
It will increase the number of Americans who are uninsured.
It will make families pay more for less care.

This is personal for Greg from Stoddard who has no idea how older Wisconsinites will be able to afford higher costs for care.

"Raising costs for a family with a pre-existing condition isn‚Äôt right, it‚Äôs not fair and it‚Äôs not who we are."
