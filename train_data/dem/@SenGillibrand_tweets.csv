"In the Senate, I'll keep fighting to close that gap, fighting for legislation like the Paycheck Fairness Act."
The data suggests that it would take until 2152 for us to close the gender wage gap. That's not right. We shouldn't have to wait that long.
"As a whole, American women must work 44 days into 2017 in order to make as much as men made in 2016."
The gap for working moms on average is $0.70 to the dollar. They have to work an extra 6 months to make what fathers earn in a year.
"The pay gap for women of color is severe. Black women make just $0.63 for every dollar a white man earns, Hispanic/Latina women earn $0.54."
"Today is #EqualPayDay. I'd like to share some numbers with you, the plain truth about equal pay in this country."

"When someone gets shot by a gun with a silencer, it's quiet. Witnesses might not hear. Police will be less likely to track down the shooter."

Spoke with @TheAltWeekly about the incredible surge of activism we’ve seen happening across the country. https://t.co/s0irGYOG0a
The Senior Financial Empowerment Act would empower seniors and their families with the tools needed to combat financial fraud.

The Family and Medical Leave Act was signed on this day 24 years ago—an important step forward for millions of American families.
"When you say that you want to defund Planned Parenthood, you tell millions of women that their health doesn't matter."
Great to see New Yorkers self-organizing after the @womensmarch. https://t.co/xAfYEAqJRt

I like the sound of that. Could always use another pitcher for the congressional women's softball team! https://t.co/aaDMd1AzbG
"We all have a voice and a role to play, and if we don't stand up and demand action, no one will."
.@AmySchumer Got your voicemail! Thanks for the call—and thanks to all NYers who gotten #offthesidelines to make calls. I've got your back.
We can't give Neil Gorsuch the deciding SCOTUS vote. If you agree: https://t.co/SQLgo6Uv5i
"If you’re ready to get #offthesidelines, join us: https://t.co/lG4LKlLzJg https://t.co/zlCfWU0RyL"
Public education. Safe schools. That’s what our Education Secretary should commit to. Betsy DeVos is the wrong choice.
".@POTUS's federal hiring freeze will harm our local economies like in Rome, NY. I'll do what I can to help. https://t.co/eVqzuhaHyU"

"As we approach 8 years since the Flight 3407 tragedy, an honor to meet with @3407Families, dedicated advocates for airline safety reform."
"Scott Pruitt will not be vigilant on these issues—in fact, his record is hostile to them. He will not get my vote to lead the @EPA."
Contaminants in our water and air threaten New Yorkers' public health. Our children and families' lives and health are at stake.
"Climate change is real. Sea levels are rising, and I've seen firsthand how violent weather has devastated communities in New York."
The @EPA must be our first line of defense in protecting air and water and combating global climate change.
I'm opposing Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court. Here's why: https://t.co/NwTgkR7DX2

Our willingness to accept those fleeing the most dangerous and violent places on earth is what the Statue of Liberty represents.

We have to stand strong.
We have to say no. 

And we must not give up. We must not give in. https://t.co/aUzFOjQJ8u"
Our Secretary of State must be willing to stand up for our values. Not convinced that Rex Tillerson would use this position to do that.
I'm concerned about his enormous conflicts of interest and disturbed by his evasion on basic questions about human rights.
I'm voting no on Rex Tillerson's nomination as Secretary of State and will urge my Senate colleagues to join me.
Proud to join thousands of NYers in Battery Park yesterday to speak out against @POTUS's refugee executive order. https://t.co/MBl5gKvSPl

I'm with you. I support you. And I'll never stop fighting for our immigrants and refugees.
Keep marching. Keep protesting. Keep raising your voice as loudly and forcefully as you can against this hateful and discriminatory policy.
"For those at rallies and protests in New York and across the country: After today, do not quiet down. Do not stop this fight."
"It's an absolute moral and ethical failure, and goes against everything the Statue of Liberty represents and our New York values."

An honor to raise my voice with thousands of New Yorkers in Battery Park today. https://t.co/oUpkKN2bKf

Taking in refugees helps make our country safer by showing the world that America cares for children &amp; families facing strife &amp; persecution.
Our willingness to accept those who are fleeing the most dangerous &amp; violent places on earth is what the Statue of Liberty represents.
Pres. Trump’s executive orders on immigration &amp; refugees fly in the face of our #NY values and the foundation on which our nation was built.
"Today we mark #HolocaustMemorialDay, a day to remember the millions we lost and to rededicate ourselves to ensuring it never happens again."
