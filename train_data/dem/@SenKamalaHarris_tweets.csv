Rosenstein now oversees the special investigation run by Mueller – which is something we should be concerned about.

Comey said he documented his conversation with Trump because he was concerned Trump would lie about their meetings. This is stunning.

Supporting women’s health is not a partisan issue.
"Under the health care bill House Republicans passed, states effectively could choose whether insurers are required to cover maternity care."
"Before the ACA, insurers could charge women more just for being women &amp; they didn’t all have to cover birth control or maternity care."

"This is the time to fight not a ""War on Drugs"" but a war on drug addiction."
"While I don’t believe in legalizing all drugs, we need to do the smart thing, the right thing, and finally decriminalize marijuana."
...they’ve also got to care about drug-addicted young man in Chicago or East LA.
"We need to make this administration understand that if they care about the opioid crisis in rural America, as they say they do..."
"We need to fund, not defund, the Office of National Drug Control Policy."
"We need to build on reforms, instead of reviving mandatory minimums and boosting bottom lines for private prisons."
"We need a national drug policy that finally treats substance abuse not as a crime to be punished, but as a disease to be treated."
Drug addiction is color blind. It doesn’t see red or blue.
"Sessions advocated that prosecutors seek the harshest sentence available, including an increased use of mandatory minimums."
"Sessions has threatened that USDOJ may renew focus on marijuana use, even in states like California where it is now legal."
"As San Francisco DA and California Attorney General, I was proud to pioneer a different approach. We named it Smart on Crime."
"The fact is, the War on Drugs did not work."
"What got less attention...was a memo the Attorney General issued the following day, to federal prosecutors all across the country."
"And with everything going on, we must multitask...as we all know, our system of justice was shaken last Tuesday."
It is far past time a special prosecutor be appointed to oversee the FBI’s investigation into Russia. Period.
It is time for my Republican colleagues to put country ahead of party and hold this President accountable.
The men &amp; women of our intelligence community put their lives on the line every day doing dangerous work to keep our country safe.
