"@CommerceGov I was glad to keep this fight going today with two of my Minnesota Congressional colleagues, @amyklobuchar and @USRepRickNolan."

Better disclosure will help the public and investors know more about tax practices of big companies.
It’s alarming that some large American companies are able to take advantage of tax havens to dodge U.S. tax rules.
I believe the public has the right to know what countries large companies pay (or don’t pay) taxes in.
