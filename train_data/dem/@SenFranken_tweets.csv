Better disclosure will help the public and investors know more about tax practices of big companies.
It’s alarming that some large American companies are able to take advantage of tax havens to dodge U.S. tax rules.
I believe the public has the right to know what countries large companies pay (or don’t pay) taxes in.

I understand how important #DACA is—these young people are American in every way except for their immigration status. #DACAWorks
"These kids, teenagers, young adults have gone to school, &amp; many have earned college degrees &amp; started contributing to society &amp; the economy."
"Because of #DACA, there are hundreds of thousands of people in our country who’ve spent last 5 years free from the fear of being deported."
This is not acceptable behavior for any American. This is especially appalling coming from the President of the United States.
"When someone shows you who they are, you believe them. Trump is again letting white supremacists off the hook for #Charlottesville violence."

"That's no way to pass legislation in a democracy, let alone one that could rip insurance from 23M Americans and alter our national economy."
"Senate GOP has decided to take the opposite approach, shrouding their health care bill in secrecy, trying to rush bill through w/o hearings."

President Trump wants American people &amp; Congress to let this thing go. That’s not an option when the integrity of our democracy is at stake.
Now more than ever we should be encouraged that there’s special prosecutor to get to bottom of what happened bt Trump’s team &amp; the Russians.
Former Director Comey's testimony makes the case even stronger that the President has continuously tried to undermine that investigation.
It’s clear that President Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey because of the Trump-Russia investigation. #ComeyHearing

MN is one of 10 states with the greatest increase in % of children covered by #Medicaid in rural areas in the years after ACA’s passage.
Medicaid is a lifeline for rural communities in MN and our nation. It's unacceptable that the GOP health care bill would gut the program.
"Given that so many of my constituents live in small towns &amp; frontier areas, &amp; on farms &amp; reservations, rural health care is a top priority."
Nearly 62 million people in our country—one in five Americans—live in rural areas. 1.2 million in Minnesota alone.
