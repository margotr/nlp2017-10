"While I look forward to reviewing @realDonaldTrump Iran strategy, his decision not to make certifications could imperil JCPOA"

"Instead of hurting families and seniors, they should work in a bipartisan way to improve our health care system."
"These schemes have been soundly rejected, yet the Administration is now trying to enact them via executive order."
"They have put forth legislative schemes that would drive up premiums, increase costs and reduce protections."
They have a maniacal obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act. That obsession is harming families across the nation.
"This executive order is trying to return us to the days when you could buy junk insurance – it was cheap, because it didn’t cover much."
"Instead, @POTUS and Republicans in Congress have engaged in a sabotage of our health care system, which has driven up premiums and costs."
"For nine months, the Admin &amp; congressional Republicans have abdicated their basic obligation to make sure our health care system works."
This is a sabotage of our health care system by executive order. https://t.co/s6uIsQXxh4

Small business can already write off $500K in investments b/c of work @SenatorCollins &amp; I did in 2015 to make the 179 deduction permanent
Republican plan gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporations; their budget cuts Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion.
"Fact Check - According to non-partisan @USCBO, profitable corporations have an effective tax rate of 18.6%."
"Worth more than $11 million? No? Guess what, the estate tax does not apply to you."
"Repealing the estate tax would give $27 billion a year to America’s 5,500 richest families."
".@POTUS says tax cuts go to the middle class. Fact Check: top 0.1% (income above $3,439,900) get an avg tax cut of $747,580 in 2018."
"Under the Republican plan, a family of four would gain $11,300 in standard deduction, and simultaneously LOSE $16,200 in personal exemptions"
Tax on a single piece of paper? We already have it. It’s called the 1040EZ
"Fact Check: Average tax cut for the top 1% is $146,470. Plan INCREASES the tax rate from 10% to 12% on family income below $18,650."
"Oh and increasing the tax rate on family income below $18,650 from 10% to 12% 🙄"
How do they make up the rest? With $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. https://t.co/fVLsVVyWZg
Their own budget reconciliation bill allows them to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. That’s a lot of zeros. https://t.co/7deyiHKzZw
So does the GOP place any value in reducing the deficit? Let’s take a look at their budget.
".@JoeBiden has said ""Don’t tell me what you value, show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you value."""
"In total, the GOP tax plan gives almost 3 trillion in tax cuts to wealthy Americans and profitable corporations over the next 10 years."
That’s equivalent to the total annual funding for Pell grants ($22.5 billion FY17) and WIC ($6.35 billion).
Repealing the estate tax would reduce revenue by roughly $27 billion/year.
"That’s equal to entire FY17 budget for the @CDCgov ($7.2B), the FAA ($16.4B), the @TSA ($7.78) and the @USCG ($10.45B)."
The GOP’s purposed changes to the top individual tax bracket will reduce revenue by about $42 billion/year.
"That’s equal to the entire FY17 budget for the @NIH ($34.1 billion), @CustomsBorder ($14.3 billion), and @FEMA ($11.6 billion) combined."
The purposed GOP cuts for Pass-through/S-corps will reduce revenue by roughly $60 billion/year.
"That’s equal to our military’s annual personnel costs (salary, healthcare, retirement contributions, etc) PLUS NASA’s entire annual budget."
Let’s start with the proposed cut to the corporate tax rate: $1.5 trillion over 10 years or $150 billion/year.
So just how much would we have to cut to keep the deficit the same? Take a look at the numbers.
"How, you ask? By definition, tax cuts reduce revenue. If you don't make cuts equal to that reduction, you increase the deficit."
Republicans are now proposing to wipe that away with a budget and tax plan that will drastically increase the deficit.
"In 2011, under the Budget Control Act Republicans and Democrats came to an agreement on $1 trillion in deficit reduction measures."
There are only two ways to reduce the deficit: bring in more revenue or decrease spending.
Thread #2: The GOP talks a lot about the importance of reducing our national budget deficit.
The only ones who benefit from the GOP pass-through rate reduction are the super-rich hedge fund managers and real… https://t.co/CWOpPkIJfM
Most small businesses using pass-through already pay less than the proposed GOP rate. https://t.co/dpn7TfYRho
"GOP tries to sell the ‘pass-through’ loophole as being good for small business, yet 90% of the benefits go to the top 1%."
"This is why @realDonaldTrump's budget is ""out of whack,"" not because a hurricane devastated Puerto Rico."
"That’s right, this hedge fund manager loophole dwarfs the entire budget of the primary department responsible for responding to emergencies."
"In context, this new loophole = FY17 budgets of NIH, Customs &amp; Border Protection &amp; FEMA COMBINED."
"Changing the pass-through rate will lower taxes for hedge fund managers &amp; real estate developers, adding $600B to the deficit over 10 years."
This new loophole is accomplished through something called a ‘pass-through.’
"First up, a look at how this plan creates new, special loopholes for super-rich hedge fund managers &amp; wealthy real estate developers."
"And throughout the day on Twitter, I'll address some of the more egregious flaws in this tax plan."
"Today in Philadelphia, I'll highlight how the GOP tax plan also RAISES taxes on the middle class to help fund these same giveaways."
"Yesterday, I met with seniors in Lancaster to highlight how this plan cuts Medicare to fund giveaways to super-rich. https://t.co/hXUba0oZWn"
"Today, @realDonaldTrump will come to Pennsylvania to push tax plan that gives 80% of benefits to the top 1% of the county."
