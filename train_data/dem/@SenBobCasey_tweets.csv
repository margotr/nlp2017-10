The U.S. should not walk away from Iran nuclear agreement
JCPOA represents best available option for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability &amp; enhancing visibility of program
"While I look forward to reviewing @realDonaldTrump Iran strategy, his decision not to make certifications could imperil JCPOA"

This destructive act by the Administration threatens to undermine those bipartisan efforts.
.@PattyMurray and @SenAlexander have been making progress toward bipartisan legislation that would improve our health care system.
"Instead of hurting families and seniors, they should work in a bipartisan way to improve our health care system."
"These schemes have been soundly rejected, yet the Administration is now trying to enact them via executive order."
"They have put forth legislative schemes that would drive up premiums, increase costs and reduce protections."
They have a maniacal obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act. That obsession is harming families across the nation.
"This executive order is trying to return us to the days when you could buy junk insurance – it was cheap, because it didn’t cover much."
"Instead, @POTUS and Republicans in Congress have engaged in a sabotage of our health care system, which has driven up premiums and costs."
"For nine months, the Admin &amp; congressional Republicans have abdicated their basic obligation to make sure our health care system works."
This is a sabotage of our health care system by executive order. https://t.co/s6uIsQXxh4

Small business can already write off $500K in investments b/c of work @SenatorCollins &amp; I did in 2015 to make the 179 deduction permanent
Republican plan gives $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporations; their budget cuts Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion.
"Fact Check - According to non-partisan @USCBO, profitable corporations have an effective tax rate of 18.6%."
"Worth more than $11 million? No? Guess what, the estate tax does not apply to you."
"Repealing the estate tax would give $27 billion a year to America’s 5,500 richest families."
".@POTUS says tax cuts go to the middle class. Fact Check: top 0.1% (income above $3,439,900) get an avg tax cut of $747,580 in 2018."
"Under the Republican plan, a family of four would gain $11,300 in standard deduction, and simultaneously LOSE $16,200 in personal exemptions"
Tax on a single piece of paper? We already have it. It’s called the 1040EZ
"Fact Check: Average tax cut for the top 1% is $146,470. Plan INCREASES the tax rate from 10% to 12% on family income below $18,650."
"Oh and increasing the tax rate on family income below $18,650 from 10% to 12% 🙄"
How do they make up the rest? With $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. https://t.co/fVLsVVyWZg
Their own budget reconciliation bill allows them to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. That’s a lot of zeros. https://t.co/7deyiHKzZw
So does the GOP place any value in reducing the deficit? Let’s take a look at their budget.
".@JoeBiden has said ""Don’t tell me what you value, show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you value."""
"In total, the GOP tax plan gives almost 3 trillion in tax cuts to wealthy Americans and profitable corporations over the next 10 years."
That’s equivalent to the total annual funding for Pell grants ($22.5 billion FY17) and WIC ($6.35 billion).
Repealing the estate tax would reduce revenue by roughly $27 billion/year.
"That’s equal to entire FY17 budget for the @CDCgov ($7.2B), the FAA ($16.4B), the @TSA ($7.78) and the @USCG ($10.45B)."
The GOP’s purposed changes to the top individual tax bracket will reduce revenue by about $42 billion/year.
"That’s equal to the entire FY17 budget for the @NIH ($34.1 billion), @CustomsBorder ($14.3 billion), and @FEMA ($11.6 billion) combined."
The purposed GOP cuts for Pass-through/S-corps will reduce revenue by roughly $60 billion/year.
"That’s equal to our military’s annual personnel costs (salary, healthcare, retirement contributions, etc) PLUS NASA’s entire annual budget."
Let’s start with the proposed cut to the corporate tax rate: $1.5 trillion over 10 years or $150 billion/year.
So just how much would we have to cut to keep the deficit the same? Take a look at the numbers.
"How, you ask? By definition, tax cuts reduce revenue. If you don't make cuts equal to that reduction, you increase the deficit."
Republicans are now proposing to wipe that away with a budget and tax plan that will drastically increase the deficit.
"In 2011, under the Budget Control Act Republicans and Democrats came to an agreement on $1 trillion in deficit reduction measures."
There are only two ways to reduce the deficit: bring in more revenue or decrease spending.
Thread #2: The GOP talks a lot about the importance of reducing our national budget deficit.
The only ones who benefit from the GOP pass-through rate reduction are the super-rich hedge fund managers and real… https://t.co/CWOpPkIJfM
Most small businesses using pass-through already pay less than the proposed GOP rate. https://t.co/dpn7TfYRho
"GOP tries to sell the ‘pass-through’ loophole as being good for small business, yet 90% of the benefits go to the top 1%."
"This is why @realDonaldTrump's budget is ""out of whack,"" not because a hurricane devastated Puerto Rico."
"That’s right, this hedge fund manager loophole dwarfs the entire budget of the primary department responsible for responding to emergencies."
"In context, this new loophole = FY17 budgets of NIH, Customs &amp; Border Protection &amp; FEMA COMBINED."
"Changing the pass-through rate will lower taxes for hedge fund managers &amp; real estate developers, adding $600B to the deficit over 10 years."
This new loophole is accomplished through something called a ‘pass-through.’
"First up, a look at how this plan creates new, special loopholes for super-rich hedge fund managers &amp; wealthy real estate developers."
"And throughout the day on Twitter, I'll address some of the more egregious flaws in this tax plan."
"Today in Philadelphia, I'll highlight how the GOP tax plan also RAISES taxes on the middle class to help fund these same giveaways."
"Yesterday, I met with seniors in Lancaster to highlight how this plan cuts Medicare to fund giveaways to super-rich. https://t.co/hXUba0oZWn"
"Today, @realDonaldTrump will come to Pennsylvania to push tax plan that gives 80% of benefits to the top 1% of the county."

Graham-Cassidy has always been about chasing the ideological trophy of 'repeal.' It will hurt families and is deepy shameful.
But Graham-Cassidy isn't about improving health care for Americans and never has been.
The sham process underway for Graham-Cassidy would be inexplicable if the purpose was to actually improve our health care system

Can the backers of Graham-Cassidy guarantee that Pennsylvanians won't lose their insurance under their scheme? That premiums won't rise?

"For people with disabilities, slashing Medicaid is anti-freedom. It’s not a key. It’s a prison."
Don’t be fooled by empty promises and lofty rhetoric about health care and freedom. Slashing Medicaid doesn’t give anyone freedom.
"They would set disabilities rights back decades, back to institutions."
The Republican health care bills will take away that freedom and liberty.
"Medicaid, coupled with legislative and judicial victories, represents freedom and liberty to people with disabilities."
Medicaid helps people with disabilities to go to work. To live in their communities. To have families.
The Medicaid program was the financial support that made those hard won rights something tangible and real.
"The Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, the Olmstead decision were all critical advances in the right to self-determination."
The last 50 years have been a period of steady progress for people with disabilities.  They have fought for and won their liberty.
"Robbed of their freedom, their right to self-determination, and usually put in horrific institutions to rot."
"For much of history, people with disabilities were treated as less than human."
"This is a perversion, especially when considering the impact on the rights of people with disabilities.  Some history is helpful here."
"They say that getting rid of the health care of tens of millions is, perversely, consistent with American value of self-determination."

This is the exact kind of bribe I warned you about. https://t.co/TxYKIiKjei
My Senate Republican colleagues will have to choose. Judge them on their choice.
There are no amount of deliberately misleading statements or slush funds that can change that.
"Are they going to cut care for 20 million and raise premiums for millions more, or are they not?"
"They are counting on your confusion, but it's really a simple question."
"Are you going to vote to jack up premiums, cut coverage for millions, impose an age tax on older workers and decimate Medicaid?"
"At the end of the week, my Senate Republican colleagues will have a bottom line decision to make."
"This obscene bill is fatally flawed, something that hammers the middle class so severely can’t be tweaked."
"This health care scheme will be a wrecking ball for middle-class families, children, seniors and individuals with disabilities."
"We won’t fall for their nonsense, their slush funds, their state specific giveaways, their do-nothing fixes."
"What Senate Republicans are counting on is that you, the American people, get fooled."
But they will allow Republicans Senators to blow hot air and tell their constituents they fixed a problem when the opposite is true.
There will be legislative slush funds for specific Senators. These slush funds won’t make health care more affordable.
"That's a scam, here’s a study to prove it. https://t.co/3CzlykNOrP"
There will be an amendment for a Medicaid slush fund that the @SenateGOP claims will help those who will lose Medicaid coverage.
"Don’t be fooled, here’s an expert who disproves that a fund is a substitute for coverage. https://t.co/OLz7qZVtqv."
The coverage that they will lose when Medicaid is decimated.
"People confronting substance abuse don’t need some fund from Washington, they need coverage-"
"Over the next few days, you’ll see an amendment for a slush fund that Senators will claim helps fight the opioid crisis. It won’t."
"Here's what they're betting on: that they can continue to scheme in secret, behind closed doors, cut deals, bribe Senators with slush funds."
"Well, today they did and, sadly, I am not shocked."
"For weeks, some of my Republican colleagues said they would never vote to move forward on a repeal bill without a replacement."
"Approximately 20 million people lose coverage, Medicaid is decimated through cuts, older workers pay an age tax and premiums increase."
But here are the facts: in every scheme put forth by Congressional Republicans-
We’ve heard it all: “health care for everyone” “no one will lose Medicaid” (cc @SecPriceMD)
They have a strategy: confuse. deliberately mislead. lie.
"So stuck between their ideological obsession &amp; the will of the American people, Congressional Republicans have chosen to charge forward."
"Americans want Congress to work in a bipartisan way to improve our health care, not scheme in private to strip health care away for millions"
They had a big problem though: the protections put in place by the ACA are popular.
"Since November, Congressional Republicans have tried to fulfill their long-held ideological obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act"
We’re about 30 minutes away from our first health care votes so let’s talk about where we are and what’s coming.
"RT @bctimes: “It’s a bad piece of legislation for virtually everyone we can think of,” @SenBobCasey said. https://t.co/Ae0jvSliNa"
I will fight this obscene health care scheme with everything I have over the coming days.
"It is fundamentally flawed and cannot be ""improved,"" no matter how many substitute amendments @SenateMajLdr drafts behind closed doors."
"This legislation is a direct economic and health care attack on the middle class, seniors, children and individuals with disabilities."
"Instead of working in a bipartisan way to improve our health care system, the @SenateGOP has just voted to undermine it."
"A ""plan"" that sells out middle-class Pennsylvanians in order to fund tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans and big corporations. Obscene"
