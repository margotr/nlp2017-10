And what kind of #TaxReform plan removes the State &amp; Local deduction when that's what keeps middle class families from being taxed twice?
"How does GOP #TaxReform ""help farmers"" by repealing the #EstateTax, when only 50 small farms or biz would pay that this year?"
"When you cut taxes on the top 1% &amp; raise them for the lowest income Americans, that's NOT pro-American. #wealthfare"
"The GOP #TaxReform plan is even worse than their healthcare plan. Instead of #wealthcare, it's #wealthfare. https://t.co/Z15ZnCuswU"
@FCC We can‚Äôt entrust them with the Internet ‚Äì they‚Äôre already working on gutting #NetNeutrality
@FCC Chairman Pai &amp; the GOP already handed over your private data to big ISPs to sell to the highest bidder.
"We need an @FCC chair who believes in free &amp; #OpenInternet &amp; knows it is a tool for science, art, entrepreneurs -not just corporate profits."
"@SenateMajLdr @FCC Chairman Pai has bucked the calls of everyday Americans for #NetNeutrality, prioritizing the demands of big cable &amp; ISPs."
"Tomorrow, @SenateMajLdr will have the Senate vote for another 5 yr term for @FCC Chair Ajit Pai. I will vote w/ a resounding NO."
The state deduction helps the middle class avoid double taxation - something I thought the GOP opposed. https://t.co/IMGO6uZIKa
"We urge the GOP to pursue mainstream #taxreform that has fiscally responsible tax cuts for Americans who need it, not donors who demand it."
"Rs &amp; Ds used to agree on the Baker Rule: #taxreform must be revenue neutral, judged on its own merits. No dynamic scoring. No Fake Math."
"If they don‚Äôt pay for it, they‚Äôll balloon the deficit and debt and then try to slash #Medicare and other important programs instead."
"On top of that, this would cost anywhere from 5 to 7 TRILLION dollars and they have no credible plan to pay for it."
"So if you are a giant corporation or in the top 1% - the GOP has a #TaxReform plan for you. 

If you aren‚Äôt?  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
Plain &amp; simple: GOP #TaxReform ‚¨áÔ∏è the tax rate on the wealthiest from 39.6% to 35%. But ‚¨ÜÔ∏è for those working to make it to the middle class.
