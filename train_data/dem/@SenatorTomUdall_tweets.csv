#Trumpcare would deal a crippling blow to the health and economic wellbeing of families in #NewMexico. Join me in speaking out against it.
The equation is simple. #Trumpcare means insurance companies will charge more and cover less.
#Trumpcare takes us back to the days when women had to pay more for services like maternity coverage.
Make no mistake: #Trumpcare gives insurance companies the power to charge people more for being sick.
"#Trumpcare means health care taken away. The bill‚Äôs Medicaid cuts alone would strip 250,000 people across #NM of coverage."
"#Trumpcare means jobs lost. This bill would cost #NewMexico 31,800 jobs over the next 10 years, cratering our already fragile economy."
Republicans look closer than ever to passing #Trumpcare. These are some of the devastating consequences it could have for #NewMexico:
