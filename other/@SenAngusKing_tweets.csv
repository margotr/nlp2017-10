"I’ll continue to say clearly, and loudly, that our rural hospitals need our help…"
"So, when I go back to Washington next week to discuss healthcare, I’ll carry the concerns and challenges of Jackman/rural Maine with me."
This impacts everything – a CBP officer told me today they struggle to recruit/keep border patrol personnel due to limited healthcare.
"That means that the a mill worker on the late shift, or an elderly citizen who slips and falls, would have to drive over an hour for care."
"At the moment, Jackman stands to lose overnight emergency medical services at the end of the year."
Communities need access to close and affordable healthcare in order to thrive.
THREAD: Spent the day talking healthcare in Jackman today. There was one thought that was present in all of my conversations:
Cybercrime costs the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year – it’s critical that we protect our networks.
Concerned to hear SEC's database was breached. This is another example of why we need strong cyber defenses.
Jackman is one of many towns with these challenges – they need bipartisan help. Look forward to hearing more tomorrow. (3/3)
