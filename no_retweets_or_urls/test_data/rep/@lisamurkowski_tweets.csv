In Healy now. Too bad @49thStateBrew wasn't open! 
Stopped by the ice classic office here in Nenana after checking out the river. Hopefully my guess is a winner! 
"First stop on our Anchorage-Fairbanks roadtrip--the Tanana River to check out the Nenana Ice Classic Tripod!

Just started our road trip from Fairbanks to Anchorage courtesy of #PavlofVolcano eruption. Yet another Alaskan adventure!
Happy volcano day! In Alaska we learn to be flexible. Here in Fairbanks until #Pavlof volcano lets us go.
"Happy Seward’s Day, Alaska! Today we celebrate the purchase of AK for $7.2 million, approx 2 cents/acre, in 1867. "
All members of my DC staff are safe &amp; accounted for. I thank the @CapitolPolice for their bravery and service!

Great story about an unlikely group of first responders to a fire. Thanks Sitka HS bball team for your quick action! 
Congratulations to UAA’s women’s bball team for making to the NCAA Division II national championship game! Go Seawolves!
Way to go @uaanchorage women’s bball team! Great job advancing to the NCAA Division II Final Four. Thanks for making Alaska proud!
"(2/2) Supreme Court affirmed: Alaska is different, even exceptional, and that federal overreach is unacceptable. "
(1/2) We must continue to rally behind John Sturgeon until lower courts also recognize what @USSupremeCourt affirmed today.
"Today's decision isn't the last step, but start of the next chapter in our fight to secure the rights promised to AK "
John Sturgeon is a hero for winning this initial &amp; unanimous victory over a tortured legal interpretation by NPS. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and the families of those in #Brussels today. Absolutely tragic.
I applaud the @USArmy's decision to Keep 4-25 Brigade Combat Team Intact. 
I am proud of the delegation's concerted effort to work with the Army to maintain the 4-25. This is good news for Alaska.
"U.S. Army officially announced it is delaying its decision to remove 2,600 soldiers from the 4-25 Infantry Brigade Combat Team @ JBER."
Hockey fans should recognize this guy! I met w/@ovi of the @washcaps to discuss how to promote active lifestyles.

Heartbreaking and shocking. My heart goes out to Jeff King and Aliy Zirkle after this truly horrific incident. 
".@SenFranken &amp; I hosted lunch for colleagues yesterday. I brought Walter, a 63 lb King salmon I caught on the Kenai! "
Also disappointed that POTUS &amp; PM Trudeau apparently ignored Alaskans' very real concerns over transboundary development.
Today’s announcement from @POTUS &amp; Canada PM Trudeau falls far short of the holistic vision we need for the Arctic:

I pressed Sec Jewell on FWS proposed rule to govern hunting/fishing regs. Is contrary to ANILCA &amp; AK's constitution:

The most up-to-date research and traditional knowledge indicates polar bear numbers are strong and healthy across Alaska’s Arctic. (3/4)

Big win for AK &amp; @JBER_Official. Thx to @SenDanSullivan for showing importance of AK's strategic military location:

This legislation is simply a win-win—for Alaska fisheries &amp; for our nation’s school children.
