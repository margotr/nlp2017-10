Good conversation and debate this morning. Lots of good thoughts and ideas shared about how to reform Medicaid. 
"Medicaid helps poorer individuals but right now money is not used efficiently-too much going to institutions, not to help patients #HCReform"
#Medicaid has poor outcomes. Patients need provider accountability. #ProHC reform
We have to go past the anecdote and look at the data: patients only receive 20-40 cents of value for every $1 spent by the government #ProHC
Medicaid is the illusion of coverage without the power of access.
".@rebakahgeeMD agrees, Medicaid spends too much on institutions and not enough on patients"
Expanding Medicaid and not seeing improvement in the service shows a problem with the program. Spending more money with no result #ProHC
