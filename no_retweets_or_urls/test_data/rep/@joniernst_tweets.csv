"""Folks, We Can't Just Abandon Our Pledge To Repeal And Replace Obamacare"" "
"I won’t stop until we repeal ObamaCare and find affordable, patient-centered healthcare solutions for all Americans. You have my word."
"My commitment to you remains the same, however. We MUST continue to work for those who have been negatively impacted by ObamaCare."
And to say I’m disappointed that my colleagues in the Senate chose this unsustainable status quo would be an understatement.
"Unfortunately, all three of those votes failed."
"Over the last few days, I’ve voted three times to repeal ObamaCare, just like I promised you."
We can’t give up.
"In the days ahead, as the Senate moves forward and considers various options, I will continue to make your voice heard in Washington."
That’s why I voted to begin debate on repealing this disastrous law and replacing it with solutions that are patient-centered.
"For far too long, I’ve heard from folks about the struggles everyday Americans face under ObamaCare."
"Wishing my friend, and American hero, John McCain the very best. Our thoughts and prayers are with you."
Happy to be on board! 
Have a safe &amp; enjoyable holiday!

The House just passed my bill to stop the Obama Administration’s latest land-grab – the EPA’s expanded Waters of the U.S. Rule.
"We need a leader to get America growing again, develop plans to destroy ISIS &amp; ensure we remain a strong, stabilizing force around the globe"
In 2016 we need to elect a strong conservative leader to the White House.
Last night's #SOTU was another campaign speech long on rhetoric and short on real solutions.
Today I voted in support of a bi-partisan initiative to audit the Federal Reserve because Iowans deserve transparency.
So excited to have another outstanding conservative woman in a position of leadership in Iowa. Congrats @SpeakerUpmeyer!
Join me in opposing President Obama's Executive Actions against our Second Amendment rights today! 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a season filled with the love of family and friends. 
Congrats to Gov. Branstad on reaching an historic milestone. IA is fortunate to have such a hard-working Governor! 
"Today I voted to fix No Child Left Behind &amp; put an end to Common Core. Our bill empowers parents, teachers, &amp; states to make ed decisions."
I’m honored to have served w/ our brave men &amp; women in uniform for over 23 years. 
"The Pres and EPA continue assault on IA ag. Cut to RFS shrinks markets 4 farmers, choices 4 consumers, &amp; threatens jobs in IA ag industry."

We need a president that will stand up and clearly communicate a strategy to destroy ISIS.  
"The pres has failed in Middle East &amp; that’s why we have this refugee crisis. We need a pres who will stand up &amp; destroy, not contain, ISIS."
Today we honor our brave men &amp; women who have selflessly served our nation. 
What does $57K mean to you? College tuition? Groceries for your family? Instead it’s your share of nat’l debt. 
Shortsighted deal on debt limit sidesteps necessary tough decisions which is why I voted no:  
We need a Republican in the White House to make sure the Keystone Pipeline becomes a reality.
Keystone had bipartisan support in the Sen. Disappointed w/ Pres Obama's standing w/ extreme enviromentalists over majority of Americans.

I’ve heard from countless Iowans who know raising debt limit is only going to make our problems worse. #CutThePork 
Many in Washington are trying to raise the debt limit again. $18.4 trillion is enough. It's time to #CutThePork! 
Last wk the DMR attacked Republicans for fighting against EPA regs on IA farmers. Sen Grassley and I responded. 
Wishing the very best for my good friend @ddkochel who will fight and BEAT leukemia! Our thoughts and prayers are with you.
I intro’d a bill to eliminate expanded WOTUS. Today's court ruling to put it on hold reminds us why stopping it is important to IA farmers.
Veterans deserve quality healthcare. I intro’d the VETS Act to create more affordable &amp; accessible care for IA vets. 
"Today the Senate passed the NDAA.  President Obama is threatening a veto, but I’m voting to support our troops.  "
Good to see folks at the Clay County Fair last weekend and I had a chance to catch up with KTIV.

"Today we remember -- and vow never to forget -- those we lost on September 11, 2001. "
Please sign the petition to stand up to @PPFA &amp; support my legislation that will protect the most vulnerable.
