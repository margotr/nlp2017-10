Today’s announcement of a US-China protocol is great news for Arkansas’s rice producers and our state’s economy. 
Appreciate the work y'all do on this important issue. 
This hearing has been a productive start to the conversation that must continue re: investments to upgrade &amp; improve water infrastructure.
"As Mr. Frazee points out, quality of life improves dramatically after getting access to reliable, clean drinking water &amp; wastewater."
"Another witness at our hearing, Andrew Kricun, notes that emergency repairs to water infrastructure cost 5-7x more &amp; aren't cost effective."
"The Water Systems Council has provided Mike, his neighbors, and families across #AR w/ quality drinking water through its Water Well Trust."
"Mike Frazee of Rogers, #AR is now testifying before the committee abt the challenges related to rural communities' access to drinking water."
The time to act is now. We have an opportunity to develop an infrastructure bill to directly address drinking water &amp; wastewater challenges.
"Small, rural communities in Arkansas are working to update aging &amp; deficient water systems. They face unique challenges in this effort."
"We can use a variety of tools (public-private partnerships, private financing, state &amp; fed. funding) to invest in water infrastructure."
"Estimated 1.7M Americans live w/o access to clean, running drinking water in their homes. We have the opportunity to address this problem."
"We tend to imagine communities w/o access to clean &amp; efficient drinking and wastewater as far-off countries, but it occurs in America too."
"This isn't a rural problem or a big city problem, R or D problem. It's a national emergency &amp; we need to find solutions before it's too late"
"Currently the ASCE grades America’s drinking water infrastructure with a D, waste water has a slightly better grade of a D+."
I'm chairing a Senate EPW subcommittee hearing about ways to fix America's crumbling water infrastructure. WATCH: 
There aren't many tougher than @SenJohnMcCain. He won't back down from a fight. Cathy &amp; I are praying for him &amp; family during his latest one

I will continue to work to promote policies that help U.S remain competitive &amp; create jobs while pushing for human rights &amp; change in Cuba.
"Through this approach, we not only trade goods, but ideas. The two go hand-in-hand."
It would be more effective to continue an open line of communication &amp; working relationship w/a government in need of democratic assistance
"By rolling back reforms that have benefited U.S. citizens, everyday Cubans and our economy, we are taking a step backward, not forward."
But a return to embargo-like policies is the wrong approach. We ran this play over and over again for 50 years &amp; results have not changed.
"I share the President’s desire to see democracy take hold in Cuba, as well as his commitment to ending the regime's human rights abuses"
