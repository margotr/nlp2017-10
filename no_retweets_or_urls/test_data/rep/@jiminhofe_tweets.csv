Thank you @CoryBooker for joining me on this common-sense solution to help infrastructure owners/operators 
U.S. Conference of Mayors reports that each public dollar invested in water infrastructure increases private long-term GDP output by $6.35
Investment in infrastructure expands our economy. Plain and simple.
We have to make sure fed mandates don’t force communities to spend millions of $ on projects that may have little impact on water quality
We need increase support for small rural communities who simply can’t afford the investments that @EPA wants them to make. @EPWMaj
We need to look for ways to encourage even more private investment in water and wastewater infrastructure. @EPWMaj
"In our proposal to help #Flint and other communities around the country, we are planning to provide $70 million to capitalize WIFIA. @EPWMaj"
".@EPA is finally requesting funding to start up the WIFIA program, although they are only requesting $15M"
We have to find new ways to increase investment in infrastructure – In ’14 we took action by adding the WIFIA to the @EPWMaj #WRDA bill
The President’s FY 2017 budget proposed cutting the clean water fund by $414M. @EPWMaj
We must support the clean water &amp; drinking water state revolving loan funds that provide low cost loans for infrastructure improvements

"Federal mandates force local communities to change their priorities, pushing basic repair and replacement to the bottom of the list. @EPWMaj"
"Taxpayers aren’t just paying for services, we’re paying for unfunded federal mandates – bills are becoming unaffordable to many Americans"
Local expenditures represent over 98% of the cost of providing services and investing in infrastructure – costs paid by me and you! @EPWMaj

"It is time for a White House that will rebuild our military, protect our borders &amp; execute a clearly-stated strategy w/ allies against ISIL"
The president's policies are weakening our nation’s security at a time when we face the most dangerous world in modern day history.
"He also is working to close the GTMO, releasing most of these terrorists to countries around the world &amp; bringing the remaining to US prison"
"Instead, he has downplayed Benghazi, called ISIL a JV team and said ISIL was ‘contained’ hours before the attacks on Paris."
Terrorism is what the president should have been discussing with the global community during his visit to Paris this past December.
And instead recognize and stand up to the reality of the serious threat of radical Islam.
I urge the president to set aside his rhetoric that global warming is the biggest threat we currently face.
The US must also continue to work together with Europe and all our allies to preserve democracy and protect our freedom-loving citizens.

"""We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back."" - MLKJr. "
There is still so much that we don’t know about the attack on Benghazi and the truth is long overdue!
This is a benefit these men and women were promised when they chose to serve our country!
"Spending cuts to benefits for disabled veterans restored, but fact we have to make an effort to restore benefits to military is troubling!"
""
"It’s outrageous that the Obama Admin could have fixed the problem before American lives were lost, but refused their need for more security."
"Benghazi attack could have been prevented had Obama Admin reacted to many warnings of crumbling security in Benghazi before Sept. 11, 2012"
The Obama Administration lying to the American People on Benghazi is inexcusable. 
"Thanks to newly declassified documents, it is even more clear the president knew the truth when he sent Susan Rice to sell a false story."
I have said all along the Obama Administration has not been forthright regarding the attacks in Benghazi.
Iraq is getting overrun by Al-Qaeda and I don't want to see the work of our troops erased. 
The issues in Iraq are threatening to undo all that our men and women in uniform have fought for. 
Wishing you and your family a Happy New Year!
"In 2014, I want to continue to stay strong for Oklahomans in the US Senate! What is your New Years resolution?"
"From my family to yours, have a Merry Christmas!"
Thank you to everyone who is serving our great country and is unable to spend Christmas with their families. Thank you and Merry Christmas!
"""When we recall Christmas past, we usually find that the simplest things...give off the greatest glow of happiness."" -Bob Hope"
Safe travels to all those who are traveling for Christmas!
Court ruled NSA data mining as likely unconstitutional! 
Today I’m discussing the National Defense Authorization Act to fund our military! 
"Today the 72nd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor we remember the sacrifice made by over 2,400 Americans. Thank you for your service!"
Obamacare is a failed system that I believe needs to be replaced with common sense reforms!

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I hope you enjoy your time with your family and friends this year.
Thank you to all @USArmy @usairforce @USMC @USNavy @uscoastguard who are unable to spend Thanksgiving with your families.
"Today, let me know why you are thankful you live in Oklahoma. I believe O.K. is a diverse and great place to call home."
"With Thanksgiving coming up this week, reply and tell me what you are thankful for this year."
"In the face of mounting threats to America, we’re crippling our military. "
"Thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and support for my family. Your kind words, thoughts and prayers mean the world to us."
Thank you veterans for your service. You are truly the backbone of our great nation. Thank you for keeping America safe!

"Gitmo a great resource for our nat'l security, prevents bringing terrorism into US. Terrorists shouldn't have the same rights as US citizens"
I'm helping lead 50 Senators who're telling Obama we will NOT be bound by the UN Arms Trade Treaty- it violates the rights of the US people
"B/c of shutdown NPS is closing national parks/memorials, putting up barriers to make a point--costing MORE than leaving them open. Absurd."
IRS &amp; White House exchanged confidential taxpayer info. The latest in a string of disturbing Chicago-style tactics of Obama Administration.

Feeling good after my heart surgery. May miss some votes-I encourage the Senate to pass a bill reopening gov't &amp; stick w/conservative values
"Obama is favoring big business over regular Americans. #Obamacare employer mandate is delayed, Obama should delay the individual mandate too"
"Obama making gov't shutdown worse by putting up a FENCE around WWII memorial, Vets can't get to it. Unnecessary, disgusting political ploy"
"Watch my friend, @jameslankford explain reasonable proposals Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree on: "
I just voted no on cloture-to allow this vote to the floor will allow Obamacare funding to go right back-

I stand with @TedCruz to #DefundObamacare. 
"I've received thousands of phone calls, letters &amp; emails expressing concerns w/ Obamacare. I share them, &amp; will work to defund Obamacare."
The full development of the Keystone pipeline will create jobs and help us get closer to energy independence.  
It would be easy to send a few cruise missiles into Syria-if it would end there. We do not have a clear military objective &amp; could escalate.
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and all those affected by the senseless act of violence at the Navy Yard today.
We can't continue to cut military funding and expect to meet our national security needs. Obama can't have sequestration and Syria.
It's Dove season in Oklahoma--
