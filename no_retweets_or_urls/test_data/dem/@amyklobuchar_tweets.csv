Talked w @MajorChiefs &amp; #MajorCountySheriffs today about how fed government must continue to be a partner for local law enforcement.
Was an honor to be recognized by @CADCA &amp; their drug treatment advocates. Know that together we can build a healthier &amp; safer country.
So sad to hear @TCFBank Bill Cooper's died. We worked well together. I loved how he never minced words &amp; always told me what he thought.
Thanks Patrice. It was a long night. To quote Coretta Scott King: Freedom is never really won...you earn it and win‚Ä¶ 
Introduced bill w @SenThomTillis that creates VA center to study/treat health problems from burn pits. Must act now to help our veterans.
Alzheimer's affects so many US families. That's why @SenatorCollins &amp; I are leading efforts to increase research funds &amp; support caregivers.

Wrote to @KaleoPharma CEO about high prices of their meds to treat overdoses/allergies. We need affordable options. 
So glad this family is reunited. But many have been torn from loved ones by President's order. It must be reversed. 
"I met Vladimir through @SenJohnMcCain ...An activist is mysteriously ill in Russia, and the U.S. needs to speak up "
Russian aggression in #Ukraine cannot stand. The United States needs to support our allies.
My bill w @BillCassidy gives VA caseworkers direct access to info they need to help vets. Could cut wait times for claims by weeks/months.
