The President-elect's continued disparagement of the intelligence community makes our country less safe.
@ibukinokoi glad to hear that. the staff who answer the phones have one of the toughest - and most important - jobs in the office.
Recap: We cannot allow Russia to threaten our democracy without any consequences. 
I am grateful for the work of Intel professionals who speak truth to power in service of this great nation.
The American people deserve to know the truth on Russian hacks. Our strength will be measured by our actions. 
New Administration &amp; IC must continue to cooperate on this investigation. Declassify info while protecting sources &amp; methods.
Russian election hacks are nothing less than an attack on our political system &amp; democracy itself.
"We know Russians hacked Republican systems. They just haven’t released that material, but may very well do so."
LIVE: Follow along with our Intel Committee hearing on Russian election hacks.  
"No preexisting conditions, no lifetime caps, &amp; coverage for &lt;26. All things ACA does right. Let’s work to fix it instead of repeal."
ACA repeal makes no biz or fiscal sense. It’s been 7+ yrs of bickering. Time to provide the American people with an alternative.
