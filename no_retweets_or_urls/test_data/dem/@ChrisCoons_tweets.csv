"Republicans are about to vote for their health care bill. Among those who know it's bad: doctors, nurses, hospitals, the public, Republicans"
My R colleagues just released their bill to redo America's h/care system. At 9:53 at night. And they want to vote on it in a couple hours.
"Let's be honest. This disastrous, fraudulent (their words) GOP health care bill isn't going to get better in a conference w the House."
"Let's work together. Let's hold hearings. Let's hear from doctors, nurses, patients. Let's try. Let's do the right thing."
That's no way to remake our healthcare system. I think we should heed the advice of Senator McCain and go back to regular order.
"Earlier tonight, 4 of my GOP colleagues said this bill was a 'disaster' &amp; a 'fraud,' but that they could try to fix it if they just pass it"

"And it’s not just governors. Hospitals &amp; providers are against it, most Americans are against it – so who exactly is the GOP trying to help?"
Several Republican &amp; Democratic Governors wrote us last night to say they oppose the GOP’s ‘skinny’ bill:
