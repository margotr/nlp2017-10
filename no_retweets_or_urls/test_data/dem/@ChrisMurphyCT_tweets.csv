"4/ Risk pools would get sicker and sicker - insurers will flee. Thus, states will HAVE to allow insurers to price based on medical history."
"3/ Without mandate, consumers in states w preexisting condition protection would logically wait to buy insurance until they get sick."
"2/ Bill gives ""option"" to states to charge sick people more. But states will HAVE to take the option bc bill has no individual mandate."

"I know everyone's a little on edge this morning, but of course I'm talking about political anxiety, not being worri… "
I was honored to be asked last night to make the opening Democratic argument prior to the final vote. My speech: 
"Last night proved, once again, that there is no anxiety or sadness or fear you feel right now that cannot be cured by political action."
I ran into John McCain as we walked underground to the Senate for the final vote. Someday I'll get to tell my grandkids what he said to me.
Reports of democracy's death may have been slightly exaggerated.

Going live with Brian Williams on the @11thHour to talk about the disaster taking place on the floor right now. Tune in to watch on @MSNBC
Enzi continues to be the only GOP Senator on the floor and he isn't talking about anything remotely connected to the bill. This is surreal.
"GOP starting to shut down debate. @SenatorEnzi just said he won't allow anymore Ds to speak on the bill, won't answer questions from Dems."
Freedom. 
I'm live on Facebook now explaining what's going on with health care in the Senate &amp; what to expect tonight. Watch:

Here we go. McConnell on the floor to unveil the mystery bill. I will be up first to start the argument against it.
"Anybody worried or writing about a ""schism"" in the Democratic Party should have been in our caucus on health care repeal tonight."

Senate packs repeal bill w conservative priorities + Trump says he loves bill + House readies w martial law = THERE WILL BE NO CONFERENCE
It's easy to decipher. He said they are going to vote to pass the Senate bill. 
""
"Details emerging on ""skinny"" bill. It's not skinny and it's not designed for conference. Looks like it's designed to pass Senate AND House."
Oh my. I just read this. And I thought it was impossible for today to get more Lord of the Flies. 
On the Senate floor. The look of shock on faces of my Democratic colleagues is hard to overstate. No one can believe that this is happening.
"Seriously, this is weapons grade bonkers. 3 Senators just announced they will vote for repeal only if assured it will never become law."
""
"5/ A few R Senators will cry crocodile tears as individual markets melt down premiums double, and millions lose insurance."
"4/ House GOP will claim axing mandate advances ""freedom"", ignore resulting premium increases and continue to blame them on Obama."
"3/ As conference negotiations stall, House R mods will be faced with no bill or the Senate bill - they will choose Senate bill"
2/ House Freedom Caucus will warm to Senate bill bc it includes end of funding for Planned Parenthood - top priority for House conservatives
Assume that the new Senate bill becomes law. Here's why: 1/ conference negotiations will fail bc all the intra-GOP caucus problems remain
Right. Going to conference is meaningless if conference is rigged to just report back out Senate bill. 
"Who else hates the GOP's ""skinny repeal"" bill? Bipartisan governors from across the country. "
Insurers to GOP - skinny repeal will implode the insurance markets: 
"Circle logic: GOP says w/o mandate people will ""choose"" to be uninsured. But that's BECAUSE repealing mandate makes insurance unaffordable."

Today's vote on health care was a gut punch but I want to be clear - this is not over. 
Going live with @maddow at 9 ET to talk about health care and what happens next. Tune in to watch on @MSNBC
"5/ Bottom line, any Republican voting for a ""stripped down bill"" is voting to fast track the House repeal bill into law. Make them own this."
"4/ House bill, with minor changes, would emerge from conference. 23 million losing care, end of Medicaid as we know it, etc etc."
"3/ And negotiations would be minimal, bc Senate GOP would have lost all bargaining power by their inability to produce a bill."
"2/ Since Senate would go to conference without a bill (effectively), House bill would act as a default for any negotiations."
"1/ A ""scaled back"" repeal bill, just so Senate GOP can get to conference, equals unconditional surrender of Senate GOP to the House bill."

5/ Are we voting first on the House bill? The first Senate bill? The second Senate bill? A brand new bill? Asking for 99 friends.
"4/ Is the mysterious $200b ""transitional"" slush fund in the bill? Brand new idea invented out of thin air last week to buy off a few votes."
"3/ Is Cruz Amendment in there or not? That kind of matters to billions of Americans who are, or have ever been, sick. They would be screwed."
"2/ For starters, uh...how much does the bill cost? Versions of bill floating around are hundreds of billions different on deficit impact."
1/ 48 hours away from a vote on a health care reform bill no one has seen. Let us count thy things that are still totally unknown.

I want to thank everyone who shared their stories with me. I am going to fight this disaster of a bill with everything that I’ve got.
This is a fraction of the stories I’ve received from people across the state of Connecticut. This bill is bad news for the families I serve
“We don't know how we will pay for a policy increase of over 5X what younger people pay. It will be unaffordable for us.”
"“Under Trumpcare with an age tax and a new law that allows insurance companies to punish older Americans, her insurance will soar.”"
Peg from Greenwich - “My wife is 60 yrs old and she is self employed. Right now she can afford insurance with ConnectiCare.”
“MS isn't a disease I could have prevented. Cuts to Medicaid will make it harder for me to afford the care I need.”
"“Without my treatment, I have a good chance of having the disease progress quickly. Luckily, now my treatments are covered."""
“Medicaid covers what my Medicare doesn't. I don't know how I would have ever been able to get my treatment and MRIs paid for without it.”
"Katherine from Simsbury - “I have multiple sclerosis and my MS treatment alone is now almost $20,000 a month.”"
"“I didn’t ask for cancer. Not a day goes by that I wish I didn’t have to fight this. Now, I have to fight for the right to health care.”"
Angela from New Canaan - “I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in 2015 at the age of 49.”
“Dominique didn’t do anything wrong. She was born this way and deserves to have a fulfilling life.”
“Who are we as a people and a country if we cannot take care of those who for no fault of their own cannot take care of themselves?”
"“Her care costs $40,000 each year. Thanks to Medicaid’s Community First Choice program, we’ve finally been able to get financial help.”"
"“She also loves school, enjoys music and singing and Disney movies. She plays buddy baseball &amp; rides horses at a therapeutic riding stable.”"
"Mark from Westbrook - “My daughter, Dominique has an cerebral palsy. She suffers from seizures and has a number of other health challenges”"
"“Rylan is 2 years old now. If Republicans pass their health care bill, his coverage could be in danger.”"
"“He would have exhausted his lifetime cap before he was even a month old. Thanks to the ACA, lifetime caps were eliminated.”"
"“After a 3-week stay in the pediatric ICU, open-heart surgery, and hours on bypass, his medical costs were nearly a million dollars.”"
"“I was worried his surgery wouldn’t be covered, but thanks to the ACA I didn’t have to worry about him being denied.”"
“Rylan was born with a congenital heart defect &amp; had to be rushed to CT Children’s for emergency open heart surgery to keep him alive.”
"Isabelle from Unionville - “Before I had my second son, Rylan, I never thought about how my insurance plan worked. I didn’t need to.”"
“I’m afraid I won’t be able to access life-sustaining care for myself and my son. I don’t want him to suffer like I did before the ACA.”
"“If protections for pre-existing conditions &amp; restricting lifetime caps are not preserved, I fear I will face certain medical bankruptcy.”"
"“Before the ACA, the disease made it nearly impossible for me to obtain health coverage, let alone affordable coverage.”"
Pamela from Ellington - “I have a potentially life-threatening genetic condition called Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) and so does my son.”
"“The Affordable Care Act saved my life. Without it, I’d probably be dead, within months.”"
"“I have friends who are on Medicaid who are petrified that if they lose their ability to get it, they won’t have health care.”"
"“Health care is the number one priority in my life, it’s more important than income, more important than anything else.”"
"“Even in a good health year, I probably have one or two hospitalizations that require IV antibiotics. I’m on a whole suite of medications”"
"Jon from Meriden - “I was born with cystic fibrosis, a disease that causes my lungs to fill with fluid.”"
To repeal without replacement and guaranteed patient protections is to deny our most vulnerable and most promising the chance of survival
"Without the protection of the ACA, she must live not only w the fear of recurrence, but fear of recurrence w no access to affordable care."
"“But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, she was able to get the treatment she needs. She has been in remission for 5 years.”"
“The cost of her care was huge. Paying for that care personally would have bankrupted my husband and me.”
"“The treatment to cure Leslie’s cancer was harsh and painful. I watched my daughter struggle daily with bone pain, nausea, chills…”"

“Slashing Medicaid would be devastating to my family. I'm a working parent and I only want to be able to care for my children.”
"""Knowing my son can get the meds he needs to keep him healthy, alive and able to move is a blessing. It's something I do not want to lose."""
“Going part time caused me to lose my health coverage and the three of us are now covered by HUSKY A.”

"“He is now 20 months old, and I have had to make some tough decisions in the past year to care for my son properly.”"
Kamera from Stamford - “I am a single mom to 2 children. My youngest has a rare genetic disease called Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome.”
“These services are thanks to Medicaid. I'm afraid this bill will hurt his continued special education services which he needs very much.”
"“He will be 8 and thanks to speech pathologists, occupational therapists and special education he has come a long way.”"
Erin from Mashantucket - “My son has autism and has been receiving services through the public school system.”
“Surgeries I underwent potentially saved my life &amp; didn't bankrupt our family. No one should choose btwn life-saving surgery &amp; bankruptcy.”
"“If the Republican bill passes, my preexisting condition - since birth! - could no longer be covered.”"
"Kristen from New Haven - “I am BRCA positive, and though I have taken preventive action, the risk is still there.”"
“But no one should have to go through that in order to fight sickness with their loved ones.”
“Im fortunate to have had so many yrs to fight alongside my mom. I would've declared bankruptcy if it meant keeping her alive &amp; comfortable”
"“The GOP bill would bankrupt families caring for their loved ones. It would make life so much harder for people with ALS."""
“ALS is expensive. It's a death sentence. But for now people can live a more comfortable life &amp; wait for a cure because they have insurance”
“There are hundreds of thousands of people living with ALS. This bill would force people to chose btwn their loved one or their livelihood.”
Melinda from Middletown - “My mom passed away almost 5 years ago from ALS. She fought for 10 years because of Medicare.”
“I rely on the ACA &amp; I can’t afford the increases I would pay under the GOP plan. Anyone can get older or sicker.” It shouldn’t be this way.
“I went back to the workforce &amp; found out my age made me less competitive in the job market. I ended up with a job but no benefits.”
"Julia from Westport - “I’m over age 55. When the recession hit, I got laid off like a lot of Americans”"
“I’m 62 years old and I know that I won’t be able to afford the 800% premium increase that would affect me under the new Republican plan.”
“I know so many independent businesses that would not be able to survive without the Affordable Care Act.”
“I went back to college on my own to re-train and finally climbed back out of the hole. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without the ACA”
"“I lost my husband, my insurance and my career in the span of two months. I had to sell our home.”"
Paula from Glastonbury - “I had insurance through my husband’s company.” He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died 8 weeks later.
“Now she has excellent coverage and no longer worries about losing everything should she get sick and end up hospitalized.”
"“Until the Affordable Care Act, she was never able to get a quality health insurance plan because of her pre-existing condition.”"
"“She is 29 now, the picture of health and has been completely cleared medically by her cardiologists.”"
Jim from Stonington - “My daughter was born with a heart valve problem that required surgery when she was only 2 days old.”
"“I have always worked hard, at my job and as a caregiver. I did it all with little to no help. ACA was there to help me when I needed it.”"
