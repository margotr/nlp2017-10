BREAKING: @ColoradoDOT to receive $15M TIGER grant from @USDOT to expand North I-25 from Fort Collins to Loveland: 
"After disc. of new superbug in Rio ahead of Olympics, Congress should pass PATH Act we intro'd with @SenOrrinHatch. "
.@washingtonpost highlights our LIFT Act provision in FAA bill as win for consumers. 
Intro'd bill w/ @SenOrrinHatch to strengthen &amp; expand CTE dual &amp; concurrent enrollment opportunities for HS students 
Our thoughts and sympathies are with all of the families affected by the wildfires now burning across the state #COFire #COStatus
Congress will soon pass part of our LIFT Act to ensure kids &amp; parents can sit together on planes at no extra cost. 
We've heard warnings for months that Zika research will stop w/o more $. Congress needs to act now. 
Thanks to the Denver police and first responders for their response to today's shooting and for quickly securing the area.
"And this partisan bill removes a ban on flying Confederate flag at VA cemeteries. Congress needs to get serious, not play political games"
Congress should cancel its extended 7-week recess unless it passes serious bill to give researchers means to fight the spread of the disease
We’ve been calling for action since February &amp; the threat is growing. 
Neither House nor Senate has scheduled a vote on a serious proposal to fund efforts to develop a vaccine and fight the spread of Zika.
"This bill forces cuts 2 other public health priorities, blocks groups like @PPFA &amp; local clinics from providing birth control to women."
#Zika is a public health emergency. It’s unconscionable Congress’ only proposal is partisan &amp; mired with poison pills.
"3 years ago today, Senate passed bipartisan bill to fix our broken #immigration system. Time to get this done for CO families &amp; economy."
Zika is public health emergency. This isn't time to play politics. Congress must quickly pass bill to fight virus 
#SCOTUS ruling correctly strikes down restrictions on women’s health. Women should be empowered to make choices best for them &amp; family.
"As #Pride2016 comes to a close, let's celebrate #LGBTEquality Day to commemorate the progress made. "
Congress should pass #VotingRights Advancement Act to ensure laws protect eligible voter's rights and encourage more participation.
"3 years ago, SCOTUS gutted #VotingRightsAct. Court failed to recognize our country is defined by fundamental right &amp; responsibility to vote."
Joined members on House floor today calling for votes to block terrorists from buying guns &amp; strengthen background checks #NoBillNoBreak
"On #Juneteenth2016, we reflect on stain that slavery left on our history. We also celebrate its end &amp; steps taken toward more equal society."
.@USForestService's streamlined permit process will allow more to enjoy CO's public lands &amp; boost outdoor rec econ

"Despite dysfunction that has defined Washington in recent years, our team is working hard to get things done for CO "

Happy 110th bday #AntiquitiesAct! W/ local support CO used it to protect Chimney Rock &amp; Browns Cnyn #MonumentsForAll 
Loved seeing our Super Bowl Champion @DenverBroncos celebrate their Lombardi Trophy at the White House today. 
Our researchers need resources to help prevent the spread of Zika and keep CO families safe. Congress must act now. 
Superbugs are growing threat to public health. #PATHAct encourages development of new antibiotics 2 treat infections

@USTreasury used our amendment to take the first step to combat currency manipulation that undercuts CO businesses. 
"Signed a letter to Senate leaders calling for a hearing and vote for @SCOTUSnom. Month and a half since nomination, it’s time to #DoYourJob"
41 days since @SCOTUSnom announced &amp; still no scheduled hearing or vote. Plain lang. of Const. is clear: #DoYourJob 
"Pristine waters, blue skies and the world’s most amazing mountains – Every day in Colorado is #EarthDay. "

"Met w/ @SCOTUSnom today. Judge Garland is intelligent, pragmatic, &amp; extremely well-qualified to serve on #SCOTUS "
Check out what travelers @DENAirport are saying about our amendment to keep families together when traveling by air: 
"Everyone, regardless of gender, deserves equal pay for equal work. #EqualPayDay reminds us we have work to do. "
Flying doesn’t need to be difficult for families. Our amdt puts in place protections to help alleviate extra stress 
The Senate passed our LIFT Act to help families &amp; pregnant women when traveling through our country's busy airports. 
Let’s go @Rockies! Looking forward to today’s home #OpeningDay. 
"Now that there is a @SCOTUSNom, time for Senate to #DoYourJob by meeting w/ him, holding hearings, and voting on confirmation."

Stopped by @Galvanize in Denver on #PathwaysToInnovation tour to talk abt college affordability 2 help boost economy 
Cont'd our #PathwaysToInnovation tour in ColoSpgs w/ tour @IPAutomation &amp; mtg w/ biz leaders about infrastructure 
Yesterday we launched #PathwaysToInnovation tour @Galvanize in Fort Collins. Talked crowdfunding w/ small biz owners 
Just kicked off #PathwaysToInnovation tour @Galvanize in Fort Collins where we discussed crowdfunding for small biz 
Spoke today at @SturmCOL about #SCOTUS nomination and why Senate has a Constitutional duty to consider @SCOTUSnom 
Paper applications for the 2016 Colorado Capital Conference must be postmarked by today. Visit

We are saddened to learn of Delaney’s passing. Our thoughts are with her family during this difficult time. 
This is no time to redline the Constitution. Plenty of time this yr to work through confirmation process #DoYourJob 
.@CUMensBball Thanks for a great season! Already looking forward to next year. #GoBuffs #MarchMadness
Bracket = Busted #MarchMadness
#GoBuffs! 
"If Senate could confirm 3 justices during GW's 4th yr of 2nd term, Sen can at least consider 1 this year #DoYourJob "
Just finished filling out my #MarchMadness bracket. Who do you have winning it all? #GoBuffs 
@POTUS fulfilled his constitutional duty to fill #SCOTUS vacancy. Now Senate should #DoYourJob. Read my statement: 
There’s still time to offer feedback on FRA’s train horn rule. Visit 
Good to see Windsor’s new safety measures around rail crossings will soon result in new quiet zone. 
"Happy #NationalAgDay! CO’s farmers &amp; ranchers play big role in providing food, fuel &amp; fiber 4 the country. Thanks for all you do #AgDay2016"
What did the Founding Fathers know about the Constitution and filling #SCOTUS vacancies anyway? #DoYourJob 
Glad @fortcollinsgov and railroads are working together to reduce delays at rail crossings 
Support gender parity on #InternationalWomensDay – and every day. #PledgeForParity 
"Congrats Peyton on a tremendous career! You’ve done so much for the game, and especially for @DenverBroncos fans. "
FRA is finally moving forward w/ train horn rules review. CO needs to weigh in to ensure changes reflect our needs 
"Time 4 Sen 2 do its job, as every Sen b4 us has. Not asking colleagues 2 support nom-Unconscionable 2 not hold hearing, vote, or meet w/ nom"
"If we want to talk about a real “standard practice,” the President only becomes a “lame duck” after the election and until the Inauguration."
Heres redline text of Const w/ “std practice” Maj. Ldr &amp; Judiciary Chairman claim. Only 7 words remain from orig txt 
This “standard practice” has historically not ever been the practice of the Senate.
Incredible that Sens &amp; Pres candidates who claim 2 b “constitutional originalists” willfully ignore Const meaning in favor of “std practice”
Here's my floor speech from last night on filling the #SCOTUS vacancy: 
"In past 100 years, Senate has taken action on every #SCOTUS nominee, even those made during pres. election year "
Judge Scalia’s judicial philosophy was understood when Reagan nominated him. Many senators opposed his approach. But they confirmed him 98-0
Denver is the #1 place to live in America &amp; Colorado Springs is #5: 
A 4-4 decision on the #SCOTUS in a contested presidential election could lead to more confusion and chaos #DoYourJob 
.@NickKristof @SenCoryGardner &amp; I intro'd resolution 2 keep senators on Sen floor during shutdowns til gov is opened 
"Or, could this happen? Chaos: "
...here’s what could have happened then. What’s in store this election season with a 4-4 court #SCOTUS #DoYourJob 
"If Bush v. Gore happens again, then what? #ConstitutionalCrisis "
Glad to have @LaPlataCountyCO support of our bill to clean up mines &amp; prevent tragedies like Gold King spill.

The Challenger's legacy has helped paved the way for a new generation of civilian space exploration led by Colorado

"Right now, almost 800,000 Coloradans owe $22 billion in student loans. It's time to  #FixHigherEd and make it more affordable for families"
CO’s diverse &amp; innovative economy is built on companies like these. Looking forward to seeing their growth in 2016 
.@KerryDonovanSD5 is right that CO's public lands are an important part of our heritage and a boon to our economy.

"In honor of the BIG Broncos game on Sunday, here’s a #TBT to rooting for the Broncos with Anne earlier this season "
We always love spending time marching in the Marade as a family and honoring Dr. King's life and legacy 
Kids need access to healthy food all year to learn &amp; grow. The cmte added our proposal. Read about it: 
Read how using Pell grants year-round will help make higher education more affordable for Colorado families 
The truest way we can honor Dr. King today is to recommit ourselves to our values and unite to tackle the pressing issues of our time
