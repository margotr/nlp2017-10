"
"WSJ: 50% of US ""could be at risk of losing protections that limit out-of-pocket costs for catastrophic illnesses"""

The equation is simple. #Trumpcare means insurance companies will charge more and cover less.
#Trumpcare takes us back to the days when women had to pay more for services like maternity coverage.
Make no mistake: #Trumpcare gives insurance companies the power to charge people more for being sick.
"#Trumpcare means health care taken away. The bill’s Medicaid cuts alone would strip 250,000 people across #NM of coverage."
"#Trumpcare means jobs lost. This bill would cost #NewMexico 31,800 jobs over the next 10 years, cratering our already fragile economy."
