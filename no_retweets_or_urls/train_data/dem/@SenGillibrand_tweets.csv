The data suggests that it would take until 2152 for us to close the gender wage gap. That's not right. We shouldn't have to wait that long.
"As a whole, American women must work 44 days into 2017 in order to make as much as men made in 2016."
The gap for working moms on average is $0.70 to the dollar. They have to work an extra 6 months to make what fathers earn in a year.

"Women, older Americans, the most vulnerable in our communities have all benefited from the #ACA. It'd be wrong to take it away."
"The #ACA gave women the coverage they need for basic women's health services like birth control, mammograms, HPV testing."
The #ACA gave millions of Americans the health care coverage they need to stay healthy.
"On the 7th anniversary of the #ACA, it’s a shame that the GOP is trying to pass a bill that will kick 24 million off coverage."
I've put together some of my best advice for how you can get #offthesidelines and raise your voice. Get it here: 
“People won’t have to choose between getting paid and supporting loved ones.” Why we need the #FAMILYAct: 
Over a million New York households rely on LIHEAP to help pay heating and cooling bills. Trump's budget will cut it. 
Horrible amendment that makes a bad bill worse. Failure of leadership. 
Americans need #paidleave. It's time to raise our voices and pass the #FAMILYAct. Learn more: 
"If a new mother has no vacation or sick days, she’ll have to choose between caring for her new baby, or the money to feed that baby."
"If a worker can't take time off to care for a sick or dying relative, he'll have to choose between a paycheck or his loved one."
To be clear: I'm voting against Gorsuch's nomination and will insist that it meet the traditional 60 vote threshold.
We can’t have another justice who values corporate rights more than individual workers' rights. Gorsuch cannot be on the Supreme Court.
"The next SCOTUS justice could help decide issues like

→ Workers' rights 
→ Women's rights"
Thousands of families in New York will be directly affected by the Supreme Court's decisions in the next few years.

Let's keep our communities safe from gun violence and keep gun silencers out of the hands of criminals. I hope you'll speak out on this.
How can we end violence in our communities if criminals can get easy access to equipment that'd make it hard for police to solve gun crimes?
"When someone gets shot by a gun with a silencer, it's quiet. Witnesses might not hear. Police will be less likely to track down the shooter."
