We agree that civilians shouldn't have machine guns. We should agree on banning accessories that allow weapons to fire like machine guns.
A ban on bump fire stocks could have saved lives in Las Vegas by reducing the gunman's rate of fire. We MUST take action!
The @nytimes analyzed the Las Vegas gun fire. The shooter fired about 90 rounds in just 10 SECONDS. 
"Major Cities Chiefs, a leading law enforcement organization, supports closing the bump fire stock loophole and S. 1916!"
An American concert venue should not look like a battlefield. Enough is enough! Let’s take commonsense steps to reduce gun violence.
The Las Vegas shooter passed background checks. He bought dozens of weapons and bump fire stocks. Our gun safety laws need an update.
Our bill is simple. Accessories that allow semi-automatic weapons to function like machine guns are banned. Read it: 
"Speaker Paul Ryan, an avid hunter, acknowledged he is not aware of any hunting purpose for bump fire stocks."
9 minutes. That's how long it took the Las Vegas gunman to kill nearly 60 people and injure 500 more. We can't allow this to continue.
164 congressmembers support Rep. @DavidCicilline's bill to ban bump fire stocks. Urge your representative to support H.R. 3947!
Automatic weapons have been banned for 30 years. We should all agree on the need to update our laws to maintain that ban.
The gun lobby says that the ATF has the authority to ban bump fire stocks. That's NOT TRUE. The ATF has made clear legislation is needed.
"38 senators support our bill to ban bump stocks. We're making progress, but we need your help. Urge Republican senators to support S.1916!"
Semi-automatic rifles fire between 45 and 60 rounds/minute. A bump stock increases the rate of fire to between 400 and 800 rounds/minute.
Bump fire stocks allow semi-automatic weapons to reach rates of fire of between 400 and 800 rounds PER MINUTE.
Las Vegas shooter outfitted 12 semi-automatic weapons w/ bump stocks. No law on the books would have stopped him from buying bump stocks.
FACT: Legislation is needed to ban bump stocks. This CAN’T be done through regulation.
Automatic weapons have been banned since 1986. Banning accessories that allow weapons to reach an automatic rate of fire is a no-brainer.
Technology like bump stocks has made the current definition of automatic weapons largely obsolete. That’s why we MUST update our laws.
The @latimes supports our effort to ban bump stocks and says that the gun lobby should back our bill. 
The Justice Department has AGAIN reversed itself on an important issue of civil rights and fundamental fairness. 
FACT: The ATF in 2010 made clear that it did NOT have authority to regulate bump stocks under the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act.

"You’d expect Senate Republicans’ 4th attempt at a “health care” bill to be better. Instead, #GrahamCassidy is the WORST!"

"A few weeks ago at @UCSFChildrens in San Francisco I met with three mothers—Kristin, Sally and Nina. "

It’s good news that this amendment was soundly defeated. It shows there is little support for the bill Republicans have pushed for months.

Mothers like Jennifer are speaking out: Please Republicans—don’t endanger our children’s health care. @ChildrensLA 
We need answers. That’s why the Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for Paul Manafort. 
Care for children with the most serious health care needs will be put at risk if we slash Medicaid. The Republican bill must be defeated.
I don’t understand how anyone could vote to advance a bill that takes health care away from millions without hearing from those affected.
"At @UCSFChildrens, I met families with employer-sponsored health coverage who rely on Medicaid to fill in gaps. It’s vital for so many."
Each version of the Republican health care bill goes beyond repealing Affordable Care Act—ending Medicaid as we know it.
FACT: Republican health bill would increase premiums for older Americans. Junk plans that don’t cover needed care are NOT “freedom.”
"Make no mistake, a 'yes' vote on health care is an endorsement of the most indefensible process on a major bill I’ve seen in 24 years."
Gutting Medicaid threatens children’s hospitals nationwide—endangering the lives of our most vulnerable children. Terrible!
The @NYTimes shows that ALL Republican health care bills are dangerous. They must be defeated! 
Our job is to protect children. I’ll do all I can to defeat a bill that jeopardizes health care for 36 million children covered by Medicaid.
Tomorrow Republicans will try to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We must make sure they don’t succeed. Keep making calls!

"(1/4) It’s troubling that Chairman Burr is demanding the return of the torture report, which detailed harsh Bush-era interrogation policies."
"As we battle the opioid epidemic, the Drug Free Communities program must be funded at the highest levels possible. "
"(2/2) U.S. Geographical Survey finds the natural refill rate for aquifer is between 2k-10k acre ft. of water per year—Cadiz drains 50,000!"
(1/2) Cadiz project wants to create a loophole to drain a crucial desert aquifer without oversight. Very harmful. 
I’m so proud of Clovis’ own Ananya Vinay who spelled “marocain” to become National #SpellingBee champ! What a win! 
The president is turning his back on the global coalition that once followed our lead. #ParisAgreement 
Cadiz water project has used skewed studies and assumptions to justify it’s viability. Join me in opposing Cadiz! 
"It’s shocking, immoral and a dangerous denial of responsibility to throw away the progress made on #ClimateChange. "

"(4/4) In the absence of real leadership from the White House, California is ready lead and will continue to #ActOnClimate."
(3/4) The science is clear: #ClimateChange is real. We cannot continue to ignore the threat it poses to our economic and national security.
(2/4) His decision to abandon our commitment &amp; isolate our country will have consequences that reverberate for generations. #ParisAgreement
(1/4) President Trump has weakened our nation by withdrawing from the #ParisAgreement. 
"If the White House won’t lead, California will step up. We will continue our fight against climate change. #ParisAgreement #ActOnClimate"
California has felt the impact of climate change. I don’t believe the threat can be overstated. #ParisAgreement 
Join me in the fight against the Cadiz water project—an outrageous example of Republican overreach. Read my op-ed: 
Breaking our #ParisAgreement commitment will leave us ill-prepared for upcoming challenges. I urge the president to keep America’s word.
All but two countries—Nicaragua and Syria—have ratified #ParisAgreement. Climate change is a global problem that requires global engagement.
#ParisAgreement wouldn’t have happened without American leadership. This effort will only succeed if we continue to honor our commitment.
"What will we do when millions of people are displaced by sea level rise, agricultural failures or disease pandemics? #ParisAgreement"
"In my view, a retreat from the #ParisAgreement would be a reckless mistake with dire consequences. #ActOnClimate "
The future of our planet is at stake. Withdrawing from the Paris Climate agreement shouldn't even be on the table. #ParisAgreement
"On this #MemorialDay, we pay tribute to the American heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice protecting our freedom and our way of life."
"Ramadan Mubarak! For those celebrating Ramadan in California and beyond, may this holy month bring you many blessings. #Ramadan"
We must protect California's farmworkers from deportation. Thank you @RepGutierrez for introducing our bill in the House of Representatives!
Fact: Medi-Cal covers 3 in 5 seniors in nursing homes and 1 in 2 people with disabilities. Must protect Medi-Cal! 
Joined @MSNBC’s @Hardball yesterday to talk about the status of the Russia investigation. Important discussion. 
Filipino veterans fought valiantly alongside Americans during WWII—reuniting these vets w/ their families is vital. 
"(2/2) They include @EWG, @MarchOfDimes, @Honest, @EclairNaturals, @TheEndoSociety, @AuNaturaleGlow and @Health4Americas. #SafeProducts"

"#Trumpcare could result in women paying $1,000 per month for maternity coverage—another reason 13 men shouldn't write Senate bill in secret!"
A good conversation with @JudyWoodruff on @Newshour last night on what’s next for the Russia investigation. 
Republicans would take $880 billion from #Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for the richest Americans. This is immoral! 
The House health care bill would devastate millions of families and shred our health care safety net. 
(2/2) Working with @RepCarbajal to help families keep guns out of the hands of those with severe mental illnesses. 
(1/2) This week marks three years since the tragic Isla Vista shooting. Join me in solemn reflection honoring the victims &amp; their families.
Key point: #TrumpCare does more than repeal Affordable Care Act. It attacks our 50-year old health safety net.

Important read: We cannot allow the Cadiz water project to happen. 
Thought I’d share this @Time article. It shouldn’t be impossible to reach a middle-class life w/o a college degree.

Heartbroken about victims of #Manchester terrorist attack. Many were children. Monitoring developments closely. Must stop this terror.
Calif. is implementing technology to ensure we’re ready for the next big quake. Proud to support this vital program. 
"In 40 years, we’ve gone from electing the first openly-gay official to achieving marriage equality. That's progress. #HarveyMilkDay"
(2/2) Combating global warming requires a global effort. The United States needs to remain part of the pact. 
"(1/2) On top of environmental consequences, I think withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement would have disastrous diplomatic costs."
I was on @FaceTheNation yesterday to talk about the road ahead for a full and fair Russia investigation.

(1/3) Wanted to share some great news: I got a call from @SecElaineChao on Saturday. She said she’d sign the @Caltrain funding agreement!
Today we celebrate the heroes of the armed forces who keep our country safe. Your service &amp; sacrifice inspires me every day. #ArmedForcesDay

(3/3) We expect better from an ally we’ve enjoyed a productive relationship with. My letter with @SenJohnMcCain: 
(2/3) Peaceful demonstrations are an integral part of American society &amp; the actions by Turkish security were an affront to these freedoms.
(1/3) Images of Turkish security detail attacking peaceful protesters in D.C. were disgraceful. Erdogan must discipline those responsible.
"(2/2) Our bill would rescind this order, protecting Americans from employers interfering in their health care. "
(1/2) A dangerous Trump executive order sets the stage for companies to discriminate or deny health care.
Another instance of the Trump administration withholding funding that Congress provided by law. Troubling!

(1/3) I will oppose every nominee for the Transportation Department until the Trump administration approves the grant for @Caltrain.
(2/2) Let’s make sure to keep the #VotingRights conversation going. We can’t allow the attempt to suppress votes succeed.
(1/2) I’m cheering today’s #SupremeCourt decision to end the push to reinstate North Carolina’s discriminatory voter ID law. #SCOTUS
(2/2) Join me in honoring the 394 officers killed in the line of duty who will be added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.

Happy #MothersDay to all the moms in California and across the country. I hope you have a wonderful day with your families.
"FBI Director McCabe said the Russia investigation is ""highly significant."" The A.G.'s recusal should apply to choosing the FBI director."
Attorney General Sessions has recused himself from the Russia investigations. He shouldn't be involved in picking the new FBI director.
I'm calling for Judiciary Committee hearings on the firing of FBI Director Comey. 
I support @SenatorDurbin's call for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to resign if he is unwilling to appoint a special counsel.
(2/2) The Judiciary Committee needs to hold hearings and get to the bottom of this. 
(1/2) President Trump and the White House have presented an ever-changing narrative on the rationale for the firing of Director Comey.
Any recordings of conversations between President Trump and FBI Director Comey must be preserved by the White House.

Americans have died to secure the right to vote. We can't allow lies about widespread voter fraud to fuel voter suppression.
It’s absurd that a commission will investigate false claims of voter fraud when states are making it harder to vote. 
Tibor Rubin was a true American hero and I’m thrilled the veterans hospital in Long Beach will honor his memory.

(2/2) I’ve now read the Rosenstein memo three times. With each read I’m more troubled by this document. 
(1/2) I’m calling on the attorney general and deputy attorney general to recuse themselves from involvement in choosing a special counsel.
White House must understand we’ll never stop the flow of illicit drugs and opioids without fully-funded programs.

Speaking now in the Senate Judiciary Committee about the #ComeyFiring. Watch live: 
We need an independent prosecutor to oversee the Russia investigation. I plan to work closely with @SenBlumenthal on this.
If Director Comey was fired to stifle the Russia investigation that simply can't be allowed to happen. 
(4/4) Sen. @ChuckGrassley and I introduced a bill in January to eliminate the EB-5 program. Please support S. 232! 
(3/4) EB-5 is rife with fraud and abuse. There have been many cases of securities fraud. The program should expire. 
"(2/4) EB-5 sends a terrible message. A wealthy investor buys a visa while 4.4 million people wait in line, some for 20+ years. That's wrong."
(1/4) The EB-5 program presents a stark conflict of interest for the White House. 
20 million Americans gained health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. We’re fighting to protect that progress and improve that bill.
Every single Senate Democrat agrees: The Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act is a nonstarter! #AHCA 
(3/3) Our bill provides farmworkers with earned legal status (a blue card) and an eventual path to citizenship.
