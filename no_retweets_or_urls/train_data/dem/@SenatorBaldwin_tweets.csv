Thank you Wisconsin for speaking out and sharing your stories. YOU are the reason that the #SkinnyRepeal was defeated last night.
I joined Republicans and Democrats to vote against the health care repeal bill last night. This is why:

Wisconsinites are speaking out because health care is deeply personal.
Americans want us to work together to lower costs. No one wants a partisan plan that takes people‚Äôs health care away.
They don‚Äôt want loved ones who depend on #Medicaid for nursing home care to have their care put at risk with caps &amp; cuts. #DontCapMyCare
And they don‚Äôt want bare bones insurance that doesn‚Äôt cover essential services they need.
People with pre-existing conditions don‚Äôt want to be thrown into a high-risk pool or priced out of the coverage they have today.
They don‚Äôt want the #AgeTax or the higher premiums that this plan is offering.
People don't want higher costs for less care.

A loved one who depends on Medicaid for nursing home care. They deserve better.
This will put everyone who depends on Medicaid at risk:

"Now, politicians in Madison will decide whether you keep the care you have - or whether it is taken away."
More bad news from the Senate GOP repeal plan: The guaranteed protections and care that you have today are weakened.
"If you have a pre-existing condition or struggle with a sickness, you could be thrown into a high-cost pool that prices you out of coverage."
"If you are older, you could pay an #AgeTax."
It will increase the number of Americans who are uninsured.
