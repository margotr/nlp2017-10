All of Obama’s #SCOTUS nominees cleared a sixty vote threshold &amp; President Trump’s nominee must adhere to the same standard.
As I stated when Merrick Garland was nominated: There is plenty of room for tough questions and respectful debate in #SCOTUS process.
I am concerned that #Gorsuch has a tendency to favor the interests of big corporations &amp; special interests over every day Americans.
#SCOTUS nominee Gorsuch’s record suggests he could impose significant new constraints on Americans' rights &amp; civil liberties.
Senate GOP did a real disservice to the nation when they took extreme step of blocking Obama’s moderate #SCOTUS nominee for nearly a year.
