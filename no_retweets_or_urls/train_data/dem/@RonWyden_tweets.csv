Submitted my official comment to the FCC on #netneutrality yesterday. TL;DR current rules are strongest 
Tell Republicans: Do not let Trump steer health care off a cliff. 
It's clear the buck stops anywhere but with the Commander in Chief.
The president would rather sabotage health care markets &amp; gamble with people's health than do bipartisan work 
Republicans have had 7 years to agree on a replacement. 6 months in full control of gov't. It is not happening. #RepealAndRun
HALF of US will have no insurance options in market next yr if #RepealAndRun passes. That’s no stable transition GOP 
"The GOP talk about a 2 year transition is a fraud. With #RepealAndRun, health care markets collapse instantly, and GOP knows it."
"#RepealAndRun is back. 
Tax cuts for the wealthy.
Medicaid slashed. 
No tax credits for middle-class families."
Instead of working together to improve health care Republicans would rather rip it away for political gain.
"#Trumpcare is on the brink because people are speaking out and standing up. Keep pushing to make health care better, not worse."
When you don't like the rules so you make yourself the umpire 
See you there! People power is what will stop this #Trumpcare bill! 
We fight for people. Health care should not just be for the healthy &amp; wealthy. Share your story:

Americans must know the answers to these questions.  Nothing could be more in the public interest.
Testimony about whether the President tried to stop an investigation is not classified and must not be relegated to a closed session.
I'd say the hypocrisy is stunning. But I'm not surprised.
DNI says sweeping up calls &amp; emails from American citizens is fine. But figuring out how many of those comms = huge invasion of privacy.
Can the government use Section 702 to collect communications it knows are entirely domestic?
""
"Dir. Coats, will you clarify this testimony and tell us the types of targets under Section 702?"
The government has given several different explanations of who is targeted under FISA sec. 702
Did any of you write memos/take notes/otherwise record yours or anyone else’s interactions with POTUS related to the Russia investigation?
Sen. Wyden has been asking for the number of Americans swept up for 6 years. 
I'll be turning over my twitter to @WydenPress during the hearing. Stay tuned for updates.

THIS is what an infrastructure plan looks like: 
Privatization is not an infrastructure plan and the White House shouldn’t be treated like a reality TV show 
Our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling &amp; Trump’s offering up air traffic control to the lowest bidder.
I introduced the GPS Act to require a warrant for location data. Because our 4th Amdt rights must still be protected 
SCOTUS should make clear that a warrant is required for law enforcement to track Americans' location. 
Keeping the American public in the dark about illegal government activity has no place in a democracy. #TortureReport
Sen. Burr should rethink this move &amp; return the #torturereport to the Administration.
Trump &amp; Sen. Burr are clearly paving the way for the lies used to justify the illegal &amp; dangerous torture program. #TortureReport
The insecure &amp; power hungry are attempting to erase history. #TortureReport
Chairman Burr asked the Admin to return the #TortureReport &amp; the Trump Admin said yes.
Remember – the U.S. shut down compounds in response to Russia’s attack on our democracy in last year’s election.
Russia used compounds for intelligence-related purposes. We need to know the national security impact of giving them back.
WaPo reports Trump is considering giving another gift to the Russians. A week after he undermined NATO. 
Trump's withdrawal from the #ParisAgreement will leave America sicker &amp; poorer.
"#ClimateChange is real. Almost every other country in the world knows it, and the U.S. must be a part of the solution."

"Further, naming a politician as FBI Director would be a grave mistake &amp; an insult to the rule of law &amp; the men &amp; women of the FBI."
The president’s actions have made a special counsel necessary. Absolutely no FBI Dir should be considered until special counsel is appointed
This kind of disclosure could harm national security by jeopardizing important sources of information needed to disrupt terrorist attacks.

"The only question is whether Trump, or someone associated with him, also coordinated with the Russian efforts."
So the question is not whether Trump actively encouraged Russians &amp; Wikileaks to attack our democracy. He did. That's an established fact.
Trump also said repeatedly that he loved Wikileaks. 
I fear my colleagues are forgetting that Donald Trump urged the Russians to hack his opponent.
"...I said that if the information didn’t come out before Inauguration Day, it might never come out. "
"In January, when Comey refused to give an investigation update..."
Dir. Comey should be here testifying to the American people about where the investigation he’s been running stands.
The timing of Comey's firing is wrong to anyone with a semblance of ethics.

The Trump tax plan delivers two body blows to Medicare and Social Security.

Our voices fighting against special interests are needed now more than ever. Don’t stop speaking out.
It’s as unsurprising as it is maddening for a party who claims to exalt individual liberties.
"Today, by confirming #Gorsuch, @SenateGOP sided with corporations &amp; the government over individual rights."
My statement on the recent events in Syria 
#Gorsuch’s record is fraught with secret law &amp; favoring the powerful over the powerless. He should not be confirmed.
#Gorsuch fails to recognize that rights are reserved to the people. Not corporations or the government.
#Gorsuch’s failure to put the Constitution &amp; the law first disqualifies him from the Supreme Court.
"At the Department of Justice, #Gorsuch practiced secret law. He justified &amp; proposed government violations of the law prohibiting torture."
Gorsuch is locked in to an extreme right-wing viewpoint on death with dignity &amp; many other views.
Death with Dignity was passed to protect citizens private choices from government interference.
Gorsuch wrote an entire book attacking the right to make end-of-life choices like Oregon’s Death with Dignity law.
Gorsuch has demonstrated hostility toward the right of individuals to make decisions about their own lives w/out interference from the state
"Our Constitution is a document of constraints that limit the government, not the people."
Originalism = political agenda whose sole intent is reserving power for the powerful &amp; limiting recognition of rights reserved to the people
“Originalism” is a political agenda masquerading as a judicial philosophy.

"Instead of changing the nominee to a judge who will put people over power, @SenateGOP changed the rules."
Any mainstream #SCOTUS nominee should be able to get 60 votes.
"I’m a NO on #Gorsuch because he is against workers, women &amp; individual rights, and for corporations &amp; secret law. "
GOP sold out Americans’ online privacy. I’m asking ISPs what they’re planning to do with your private info… 
Going to leave this right here #SCOTUS 
Just one example: My Build America Bonds Act – part of the stimulus – financed over $180 billion in infrastructure projects
Trump’s claim the stimulus didn’t “build” anything is patently false

Searching devices should require a warrant. It’s simple. Urging Congress to pass our Protecting Data at the Border Act.
Your rights don’t disappear just b/c you’re near the border. Intro'd bill to require warrants for digital searches 
Working to pass #PaycheckFairnessAct because this ⬇️ is unfair &amp; unacceptable. 
Earning less means less savings for retirement or for college. Unequal pay is wrong &amp; has far-reaching consequences  #EqualPayDay
Pay inequality is wrong &amp; it hurts economic security for women &amp; families. Passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct = big step fwd. #EqualPayDay
Congrats to my friend Mike Thorne for this well-deserved #leterbuck honor from the @PendletonRUP:

Proud to have worked on getting this heroic Oregonian the recognition he so richly deserved.

Bottom line: Americans want quality health care at affordable costs. That should be the priority over scoring political points.
"The Administration, through @SecPriceMD’s Health Department, will be responsible for costs and whether markets succeed or fail."
Important to watch in the days ahead: GOP is rooting for health care markets &amp; ACA to collapse.
24 million working Americans &amp; 110 million seniors &amp; low-income Americans can breathe easier for now. Your voices are making the difference.
