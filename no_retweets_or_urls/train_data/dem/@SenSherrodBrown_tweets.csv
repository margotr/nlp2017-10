"Recently, @CFPB finalized payday lending rule, to rein in predatory payday loans that often keep working people trapped in a cycle of debt."
These payday lenders saddle borrowers with triple-digit interest rates &amp; cost Ohioans over $500 million/year in fees alone.
Why did Ohio try to cap these rates? Shady payday lenders have only their own interests at heart.
Ohio has the highest payday loan prices in the US - despite the fact that almost 2/3 of Ohioans voted to cap payday loan rates.
"Now more than ever, Congress should come together and prevent prices from spiking for Ohio families. -SB"
President Trump’s actions threaten to raise healthcare costs and jeopardize insurance coverage for Ohioans.
Pulling the rug out from under efforts to make Ohioans’ health insurance more affordable is not the way to make healthcare work better.

There’s a lot of conversation about what exactly #GrahamCassidy would do to your health insurance – here’s what the experts are saying:
"WATCH LIVE: Sherrod stands w/ Ohioans against Graham-Cassidy, which takes away our number one tool to fight opioids. "
"@cbo We cannot let politicians in Washington, with taxpayer-funded healthcare, pull the rug out from under Ohio families and communities."
@cbo And #GrahamCassidy allows insurance companies to charge Ohioans age 50 and older more for their insurance.
"According @CBO, the House GOP plan - nearly identical to #GrahamCassidy - would cause premiums to go up an average of about 20% next year."
"And whether or not you're on Medicaid, you're looking at a premium increase next year if #GrahamCassidy becomes law."
As well as the 3 in 5 nursing home residents in Ohio who rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of their care.
"Also hurt: 71,000 veterans in Ohio who get their coverage through Medicaid, and 150,000 Ohioans getting opioid treatment."
"So who gets hurt by these Medicaid cuts?
To start: 973,000 children in Ohio who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance"
"It cuts a net $20 BILLION from Ohio. For every $1 OH spends on Medicaid on average, 63¢ comes from federal $ that #GrahamCassidy would cut."

"It freezes @PPFA funding, It weakens protections for coverage w/ pre-existing conditions.
 
It's bad for Ohio and it's bad for our country."
"It enables states to redefine what qualifies as an ""essential health benefit"" – taking 10 benefits away from Ohio families."
It allows insurers to slap an age tax on Ohioans 50 + and raises their premiums.
This bill slashes the No. 1 tool we have in the opioid fight — Medicaid treatment.
It will undoubtedly cause premiums to spike.

My concern isn’t whether today’s nominees have a great deal of experience working for banks. They do.
Mr. Quarles bemoaned the role of “the government” as a “player in the financial sector” rather than a “referee.”
"Mr. Otting’s bank made money by kicking seniors out of their homes, and then turned around and said the government made them do it."
It was an opportunity to profit by flipping failing banks bought at low prices &amp; foreclosing on working fams–all while raking in taxpayer $.
"But for wealthy bank executives and private equity investors, the crisis wasn’t a life-changing event."
"The financial crisis devastated the Ohio families that lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings."
Banks were not “well capitalized.” Taxpayers paid billions to bail those banks out while Quarles &amp; his co turned a profit off of the crisis.
"Contrary to Quarles’s predictions in 06, the economy was not “strong,” the financial sector was not “healthy” &amp; our future was not “bright.”"

"4: 40% of kids – or 2 out of every 5 kids – in Ohio are covered by Medicaid, a program that will be cut by 20% under the GOP plan."
5: 5:1 age bands would allow insurance companies to charge 50+ Americans more w/ an age tax. Premiums for all ages would go up 20% next yr.

Folks with pre-existing conditions shouldn't be charged more for healthcare. It's as simple as that.
"...and ulcers. To name a few. And chances are, you or someone you know has dealt with something (or multiple things) on this list."
"...sickle cell disease, skin cancer, sleep apnea, sleep disorders, stent, stroke, thyroid issues, tooth disease, tuberculosis..."
"...paraplegia, Parkinson's disease, pregnancy, restless leg syndrome, schizophrenia, seasonal affective disorder, seizures..."
"...muscular dystrophy, narcolepsy, nasal polyps, obesity, OCD, organ transplant, osteoporosis, pacemaker, panic disorder, paralysis..."
"...kidney disease, kidney stones, kidney transplant, leukemia, lung cancer, lupus, lymphoma, mental health issues, migraines, MS..."
"…gout, heart disease, heart murmur, heartburn, hemophilia, hepatitis C, herpes, high cholesterol, hypertension, hysterectomy..."
"...cystic fibrosis, DMD, depression, diabetes, disabilities, Down syndrome, eating disorder, enlarged prostate, epilepsy, glaucoma..."

"AIDS/HIV, acid reflux, acne, ADD, addiction, Alzheimer's/dementia, anemia, aneurysm, angioplasty..."
