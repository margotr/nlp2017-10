"@PPFA Americans &amp; Latinos will suffer if #ACA is repealed. Please, speak out &amp; speak up. The GOP needs to know you want to keep your #ACA"
@PPFA Republicans' efforts to repeal the #ACA &amp; pass #Trumpcare betrays their duty to work for what's best for all Americans.
"#Trumpcare guts @PPFA. Nearly 22% of their patients are Latinos. W/out access to @PPFA, Latinas are at risk of losing access to care."
Latinas have the highest rates of cervical cancer - one of the most preventable cancers. #ACA provides Latinas access to preventative care
Cuts to #Medicaid will have a severe impact on Latinas. 17m Latinas now have access to free preventative care. #ACA repeal would undo this.
"Since the #ACA was passed, the uninsured rate for Latino children has been cut nearly in half - the largest decrease than any other state."
"Over 1/4th of NV's population is Latino, and work jobs that don't provide health insurance. Nevada's Latino communities rely on the #ACA."
