"Instead of again demeaning or denouncing American judges, Pres. Trump should accept this ruling and rescind the order immediately."

Senator McConnell must now bring this healthcare agreement to the Senate Floor for immediate consideration and a vote.

"Without urgent action by @CDCgov &amp; @HHSGov, Puerto Rico risks unprecedented public health calamity as conditions worsen &amp; illness spreads."
I am demanding investigation of Admin's faltering Puerto Rico response - a grave concern for many CT families with loved ones on the ground.
We cannot declare Mission Abandoned while American lives hang in the balance. Robust relief needed now.
Puerto Rico’s resilience in the face of tragedy is unparalleled. Our federal relief effort should be too. 
It is a deep disservice to Puerto Ricans for the difficult questions being asked of federal relief agencies to continue to go unanswered.
"HHS and CDC must prioritize disease control, prevention, and treatment - to prevent worsening of crisis and allow Puerto Rico to recover."
"Without rapid action to prevent epidemics &amp; stop spread of diseases, treating sick Puerto Ricans will burden an already stressed system."
Americans deserve to know what CDC and HHS are doing to address faltering Puerto Rico response and forestall unprecedented illness &amp; death.
More than 1/3 of Puerto Rico lacks clean water. Infectious diseases are spreading. Americans are drinking water from hazardous waste sites.
"Nearly a month after Maria, Puerto Rico is teetering toward a terrifying collapse with deadly consequences. We cannot turn a blind eye."
@FCC The FCC must reassure Americans that it will not be bullied by the President into abandoning our core First Amendment freedoms.
"I am urging all @FCC commissioners to stand up for our free press and reject Pres. Trump's unacceptable, un-American threats."

"ACA is law of the land. President Trump should work w/ both parties on improvements, instead of using regular Americans as political pawns."
I urge @DHSGov Inspector Gen. to quickly investigate Trump Admin handling of Puerto Rico relief. No excuse for self-promotion &amp; subterfuge.
"We need full truth about situation in Puerto Rico, not self-promotional videos that sugarcoat catastrophic crisis on the ground."
Americans need to know whether the Trump Administration is truly focused on helping millions of citizens suffering in Puerto Rico.
Congress must rescue health care from Trump sabotage. Onward Sens. Alexander &amp; Murray. Bipartisan work is our only hope.
"Mean-spirited, rash, irrational - Trump's ending critical ACA subsidies shreds health care protections and shatters promises."
Trump's sabotage of ACA seems boundless - a health care tragedy unfolding for countless Americans.
Must do much more to hold Iran accountable for other malign actions. President has failed to do so. This misstep will make that even harder.

Trump’s sad and outrageous #DACA action should prompt even stronger bipartisan support for DREAM Act – more urgent and necessary than ever.
No such thing as “orderly wind-down” of #DACA. This despicable decision upends families &amp; derails hundreds of thousands of DREAMers' lives.

Eliminating #DACA would be the height of hypocrisy and inhumanity. Deliberately cruel and demagogic.

My constituents know this bill would decimate access to the #healthcare they need. I vow to fight it tooth and nail.

Historic cruelty and catastrophic harm in Trump budget. I will fight for people he throws under the budget bus. 
America's most vulnerable take the biggest hit in tragic Trump budget. This disastrous document should be dead on arrival.
The Art of the Steal: Trump's reverse Robin Hood budget rips off the most vulnerable - all to enrich people like him.
Concealment of lobbyist conflicts of interest is unconscionable. Fight for full disclosure. #standwithshaub 
Hopeful that @Yale will begin good faith negotiations with @33unitehere as soon as possible.
Trump bowing to the Saudis reminds me of the fable of the frog giving a lift to the scorpion. We are going to get stung.
Republicans' choice of sabotage over solutions is already impacting those who can least afford it. 
"Congress must review Saudi deal to ensure it truly supports our security, preserves Israel's military edge &amp; maximizes US manufacturing."
How do arms sales to Saudi Arabia enhance our national security - if they're used to slaughter civilians in Yemen?

Their brazen strategy is clear. Republicans will sabotage healthcare for everyday Americans to hand the wealthiest more tax breaks.
Chaos and unpredictability caused by Republicans is now a driving force behind rising premiums.
The GOP’s constant claims that the #ACA is “imploding” – despite record low uninsured rates – causes dangerous uncertainty for consumers.

"Drip, drip, drip - only a special prosecutor can collect evidence &amp; stop spreading fire. No one is above the law. "
"All relevant actors including Comey, Sessions, Rosenstein, and McGahn should testify before @senjudiciary publicly and under oath."
"All of the evidence – including transcripts, tapes, memos, and other documents – must be subpoenaed immediately."
I am stunned that any of my colleagues would oppose appointing an independent special prosecutor after this astonishing revelation.
We are witnessing an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time.
Independent special prosecutor. Now. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to publicly back an independent special prosecutor. Put country before party.
We deserve to know what Trump said to Comey/Russians. Subpoenas of tapes &amp; transcripts only way to ensure evidence is preserved &amp; produced.
"Trump's dangerous and reckless leaks to Russian adversaries, legal or not, have imperiled intelligence sources and alienated allies."
Congress must subpoena transcripts &amp; tapes to determine if they exist. This is the only way we can verify what was… 
All potential Trump tapes should be subpoenaed to uncover truth and preserve evidence - both Comey and meeting with Russians.
"Trump may have helped Russia twice – by sharing classified info, and doing incalculable damage to our own alliances. "
Trump owes us an explanation for putting lives at risk- he's betrayed his first responsibility to the safety &amp; security of the United States
"This bombshell report is astonishing &amp; appalling - betraying our allies, endangering safety of sources, &amp; sabotaging our war against ISIS."
(Dis)trust and verify - subpoenas for the White House tapes are absolutely necessary.
Congress must subpoena White House tapes - only way to verify if they exist and find out what's on them. Voluntary reliance inadequate.
Syria news recalls humanity’s darkest days - the world must hold Assad &amp; his Russian abettors accountable. 
"Mounting evidence of political interference, inc. possible obstruction of justice,means independent special prosecutor more vital than ever"
"The need for an independent special prosecutor is crystal clear - if Deputy AG won't step up, I’ll introduce a bill to establish one."
No FBI director should be confirmed until an independent special prosecutor for #TrumpRussia investigation is appointed.
Wishing a wonderful #MothersDay to all the moms in #CT and across the country. Thank you for all that you do.

.@senjudiciary Trust in administration impossible as long as it refuses to name an independent special prosecutor.
Deputy AG Rosenstein and AG Sessions should immediately testify before @SenJudiciary - only way to get the truth about #ComeyFiring.

More deflection &amp; distraction from White House press room today. Time for special prosecutor is now - answers &amp; accountability cannot wait.
"Hope to see growing, bipartisan support for special prosecutor – only path to objective &amp; independent Trump/Russia investigation."
"Mounting evidence, including subpoenas, suggests FBI probe closing in on Trump associates. #ComeyFiring timing couldn't be more suspect."
No question that an independent special prosecutor is necessary. Nothing less than integrity of our justice system at stake.
Now is no time for distraction and deception. Americans want the truth uncovered and lawbreakers held accountable. Need special prosecutor.
President Trump - Your bullying won’t silence my calls for an independent prosecutor and  investigation.

Ensuring credibility and faith in non-political FBI requires appointment of independent special prosecutor. #Comey
Firing of #Comey compromises investigation of White House ties to Russians – no doubt now special prosecutor is necessary.
The need for an independent special prosecutor is now crystal clear.
