Trump’s budget would kill thousands of #cleanenergy jobs in the U.S. – a misguided effort to hold onto the past at the expense of our future
Statement on President Trump’s reckless budget proposal #TrumpBudget 
NOW on the Senate floor voicing my opposition to Trump’s budget proposal that cuts some $800 billion from #Medicaid 
"TODAY @ 3PM ET I’ll speak on the #Senate floor to oppose draconian cuts to #Medicaid in Pres. Trump's budget 
WATCH: "
WA &amp; states across the U.S. have been hit hard by the #opioidepidemic &amp; Drug Courts have helped to save lives. May is Nat'l #DrugCourtMonth
"In the wake of last night’s horrific attack, we continue to wish our friends in the UK strength &amp; solace at this extremely difficult time."
"Trump must honor promises, not alter protections previous presidents have put in place to protect #NationalMonuments "
It’s a great Monday when #Seattle @Mariners very own #baseball legend @RealKingFelix stops in to say hi!… 
Rolling back protections for a prized public space like #Hanford Reach represents another broken promise from Trump 
"Happy #BiodiversityDay! WA has rich diversity in species, ecosystems &amp; landscapes that attract tourism &amp; promotes economic growth #IDB2017"
The FCC is threatening your internet access. But we’ve won on this before &amp; we can win again. Learn what you can do! 
"@FCC #NetNeutraility roll back will impact how you watch movies, listen to music, do homework &amp; business, talk to family &amp; consult a doctor"

"@FCC #NetNeutraility roll back will impact how you watch movies, listen to music, do homework &amp; business, talk to family &amp; consult a doctor"
See what the internet could look like w/o #NetNeutraility rules to protect #OpenInternet &amp; how to #SaveOpenInternet… 
Today’s @FCC vote to roll back #NetNeutrality is bad news for every American who depends on #OpenInternet &amp; the 3 million+ jobs it provides
Here’s what could happen if the FCC rolls back #netneutrality. Visit -&gt; 
"The jobs of almost 3 million Americans rely on #OpenInternet &amp; a robust Internet economy – 878,400 of those jobs are in Washington state"
Today Trump's @FCC stands ready to go against the demands of 4 million American consumers and reverse existing #NetNeutrality rules
Congress needs to get to the bottom of what happened with Russian interference into our 2016 election &amp; possible ties to the Trump Admin
I still have concerns and questions about the involvement of Attorney General Sessions in the firing of FBI Director Comey.
Here's my statement on appointment of a special counsel to lead FBI Russia investigation: 
#ICYMI the #AHCA makes it harder for schools to cover special education. #SchoolsNeedMedicaid 
I joined my colleagues to raise concern about AG Jeff Sessions involvement in the firing of FBI Director Comey 
I'm urging an investigation into whether Jeff Sessions violated his recusal &amp; the rules that govern it for his role in the firing of Comey
"An #OpenInternet is a powerful tool for civic engagement, and a means for economic &amp; social mobility, that all Americans deserve access to"
39% of children have health insurance through #Medicaid. House Republicans’ #AHCA puts that in danger. #SchoolsNeedMedicaid
Agree. Health reform MUST make things better – not cut #healthcare for Americans who need it most  
More than 1 MILLION COMMENTS have been submitted by Americans to the @FCC on #NetNeutrality. Protect a free and #OpenInternet!
"A free &amp; #OpenInternet  is of great importance to our nation’s economy, our innovators, entrepreneurs &amp; consumers – especially women &amp; girls"
If Trump has his way big cable &amp; telephone companies will be able to cut back room deals to determine what info con… 
Tomorrow the @FCC &amp; @AjitPaiFCC vote to erect slow &amp; fast lanes for the internet. We CANNOT allow this. Protect #NetNeutrality!
We must stand up &amp; protect the American spirit of entrepreneurship by making sure that #NetNeutrality &amp;… 
Rolling back #NetNeutrality so big cable &amp; telecom providers can erect toll lanes would threaten the fundamental nature of the #Internet
A strong #OpenInternet is without question needed to drive innovation &amp; create jobs. Yet Trump stands ready to undo our #NetNeutrality rules
Wishing my friend &amp; colleague @maziehirono a quick recovery. We know your strength in the fight you show every day… 
I am deeply concerned w/ any review of #NationalMonuments designations &amp; proposed changes to modify or rescind these protected #publiclands

I stand ready to make sure my colleagues &amp; this administration keep our commitment to #Hanford site cleanup #ICYMI → 
"As the #opioidepidemic impacts communities across WA state &amp; the nation, patients need more access to treatment - NOT #AHCA cuts to care"
Our nation is in the midst an #opioidepidemic that has shined a spotlight on barriers to patient access to life-saving care #ProtectOurCare
Moving forward as a country means continuing to innovate in #healthcare &amp; #Medicaid as we have done in WA 
"#Medicaid helps kids grow up to reach their full potential, helping them miss fewer school days, have better grades, health &amp; future income"
We cannot allow the Republican war on #Medicaid to be waged on our children  
"CHIP or #AppleHealth for Kids, in WA builds on #Medicaid to cover kids in working families not eligible &amp; lack affordable private coverage"
This is too important. #Medicaid has been a bedrock of how children get access to #healthcare in our country 
Happy #MothersDay to all the moms who raise &amp; inspire us! We must continue to support the success of mothers &amp; their families everywhere!
Going LIVE today on FB @ 1PM PST to #resist Trump settlement allowing the proposed #PebbleMine in #BristolBay WATCH: 
Trump has allowed settlement rolling back #CleanWaterAct safeguards protecting #BristolBay #salmon &amp; the thousands of jobs that depend on it
Our #NationalMonuments ensure Washingtonians &amp; all Americans can enjoy our iconic natural resources today &amp; into the future
"Hanford Reach has preserved a unique natural, cultural, historical, scientific &amp; educational asset for all Americans "
""
Over 100 yrs of #conservation undone in just a few days by President Trump. Our #NationalMonuments are under attack 
"Democrats stand ready, as we always have, to develop a #healthcare fix w/ Republicans that improves quality, lower costs &amp; expands coverage"
"Up to 700,000 in WA state would be at risk of losing their #healthcare under #AHCA which could cap benefits for roughly 3M Washingtonians"
Proud to see the #outdoor industry take such a bold step and fight back against these attacks on our #PublicLands 
This administration must protect our coastal fishing economies by supporting #CleanWaterAct protections for #BristolBay not a #PebbleMine
Ahead of EPA Settlement I warned President Trump allowing #PebbleMine to proceed will be catastrophic &amp; irreversible 
My constituents want answers about who knew about the Russian interference. And they deserve them. #ComeyFiring
I want to get answers for WA state &amp; all Americans about Russian government interference in our election &amp; prevent it from happening again.
""
"Americans deserve to know, was Comey fired bc he was closing in on info that might have incriminated people within… "
#ComeyFiring is shocking because the reasons for his firing by President Trump are things we knew &amp; talked about 3 months ago. So why now?
This is a choice between #pollution or people &amp; it would be a huge step backwards if this #methane rule is repealed 
During the short time since the election women &amp; their families have been under a constant &amp; unprecedented attack

"Senate &amp; House Judiciary Committees are going to continue investigating Trump's ties to Russia, but we need a special independent prosecutor"

"#AHCA cuts Medicaid for 14M &amp; draconian arbitrary budget caps will make states decide: cut patient care, benefits or provider reimbursements"
"Why is #AHCA a broken promise? As a candidate Trump said he was NOT going to cut #SocialSecurity, #Medicare, or #Medicaid... #BrokenPromises"
"#ACA finally ensured coverage for those with preexisting conditions to quality, affordable #healthcare. #AHCA will take us backwards"
"#AHCA cuts access to affordable reproductive #healthcare like #birthcontrol, lifesaving cancer screenings &amp; #maternity care #BrokenPromises"

With a $14 trillion retirement savings gap &amp; 55 million Americans w/o access to workplace retirement savings this GOP CRA will make it worse
Republicans want to make it harder for Americans to save for #retirement &amp; we’re fighting back. 
"Senate Republicans are blocking innovative solutions in states like WA &amp; killing proposed private retirement savings systems
