That’s a bad deal for Michigan families and you can count me out!
The Republican budget cuts $473 billion from Medicare and $1 TRILLION from Medicaid. That’s outrageous!

Budgets aren’t sterile numbers on a spreadsheet. Budgets are about people. And this R budget shows that the American people are not valued!

It's now important that we work on a bipartisan basis to find solutions that lower health care costs and improve care.
"Because of these actions, the Republican attempts to take away health care from millions of Americans failed tonight!"
"Over the past few months, so many people in Michigan shared their stories, made phone calls, and spoke out against the Republican bill."
"

Every person deserves to know what we are voting on tonight. Republicans need to show us their health care bill!
We as Democrats want to work together to lower costs - especially the outrageous cost of prescription drugs!
Every single Republican health care proposal leads to higher costs and less coverage!

It’s time for Republicans to show us the bill!
Let’s focus on lowering the outrageous cost of prescription drugs and out of pocket costs.
"Costs go up and care goes down, all to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires."
Republicans are hiding their bill because they know it’s a bad deal for the American people and Michigan families.
"And if you’re a senior whose rates are going to skyrocket, you have a right to know what’s in the bill."
"If you’re a woman who will be charged more for insurance, you have a right to know what’s in the bill."
"If you have epilepsy and will lose your insurance, you have a right to know what’s in the bill."
"If you have cancer and won’t be able to get coverage, you have a right to know what’s in the bill."

The House Republican plan is bad for Michigan and I will oppose it in the Senate!
"If your mom or dad has a preexisting condition like arthritis, heart disease, breast cancer, or kidney disease they might not get covered."
"If your son or daughter has a preexisting condition like diabetes, autism, a heart condition, cancer they might not get covered."
Their bill would kick 24 million people off their health insurance and create chaos in the health care system.
House Republicans instead are voting on a plan that raises costs for less care &amp; takes us back to days when insurance co's were in charge.
"We need to work across the aisle to lower health care costs for Michigan families &amp; small biz, bring down prescription drug costs &amp; more."

Trump’s tax plan is light on helping the middle class and heavy on giveaways to corporations and billionaires. 
"Under the House Republican plan, insurance companies won't have to cover prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health and more."
Their plan removes patient protections so insurance companies could once again charge people more if they have a preexisting condition.
I’m committed to making health care reforms that lower costs. But the new House R plan raises costs and makes an already bad plan worse.

"Tim from Port Huron: ""Since retiring my wife and I have traveled extensively throughout the United States and abroad..."
Gerald from Sparta: “I take my kids and grandkids to enjoy the beauty and teach them we have a responsibility to care for our Great Lakes.”
…it’s hard to put into words what an important part the Upper Peninsula and Great Lakes have played in my life.”
Jennifer from Howell: “My dad grew up in Ishpeming and every year I looked forward to our trips ‘up North’ in the summer and at Christmas…
Donna from Muskegon: “I came here for grad school &amp; Michigan is now my home. I hope our gov’t protects the waters and shores of our state.”
…the reaction whenever I bring someone to the Lake Michigan shore is always the same: they’re stunned.”
"Bruce from Bloomfield Hills: “fireworks over Little Traverse Bay, ferry rides to Mackinac Island, sunsets in South Haven…"
The responses were incredible!  So many people shared memories about their families and children and I want to share some of them with you.
That’s why I asked folks in Michigan to stand up to protect our Great Lakes and share their favorite Great Lakes memories on my website.
"I was born and raised in Michigan and love our Great Lakes. If you live in Michigan, I know you feel the same way."
"The Great Lakes are absolutely critical to our economy in Michigan and funding supports fishing, boating, hunting, and more."
