A vote for #SkinnyRepeal is salt in the wound for millions of American families who are worried about their health care.
This is not a 'skinny' plan - it's a plan with terrible consequences resulting in millions of Americans losing health care
How can GOP Senators vote yes on this 'disaster' of a bill? 
Virginia families could feel the impact of a skinny repeal bill right away. It would increase premiums 20% next year alone

"I'm using this test for votes on GOP health care bills: will it raise costs for Virginians and/or take their care away? If so, I'll vote no"
GOP health care bill will cause Virginians to lose insurance &amp; pay much more for health care. Why aren't we helping people get better care?
The stakes could not be higher when it comes to people's health care. Call your Senators to share your stories &amp; ask them to #SaveACA
"The message I'm hearing from families in every corner of VA: #SaveACA &amp; #ProtectOurCare. We were elected to help people, not hurt them"

"Quoting citizen Donald Trump in 2013: ""The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria--big mistake if he does not."""
2001 AUMF doesn't give legal authority for the airstrikes in Syria. It was drafted for military actions vs 9/11 terrorists
Trump Administration has escalated ground combat in Syria and now air strikes against a Syrian airbase. All without Congress
Assad is a brutal dictator who must be held account for atrocities. But the President's failure to seek congressional approval is unlawful

Judge Gorsuch’s selective activism in restricting women’s rights is jarring &amp; doesn't demonstrate a philosophy that belongs on #SCOTUS
He has argued bosses have an individual right to prevent their company's female employees from using health insurance to buy contraception

"GOP should take this opportunity to abandon #TrumpCare that would harm millions, sit down with Dems &amp; talk seriously about improving the ACA"
#TrumpCare eliminaría la expansión de #Medicaid y le quitaría la cobertura que 3.2 millones de latinos obtuvieron con la #ACA
#TrumpCare le quitará cobertura médica a muchos de los 4 millones de adultos y más de 600mil niños latinos que obtuvieron cobertura con #ACA
"#TrumpCare won't improve the quality of care for Americans or lower costs. ACA already works for millions. Let's improve it, not break it!"
Using #ACA anniversary as an arbitrary deadline to rush through #TrumpCare for symbolic reasons is ridiculous. GOP must take this seriously
#TrumpCare ends the #ACA #Medicaid expansion &amp; dismantles the program as we know it. Bad for millions of Americans who depend on #Medicaid
#TrumpCare would double the number of uninsured people under the age of 65
"The #ACA has insured over 20 million Americans in 7 years, while #TrumpCare stands to leave 24 million fewer people with health care"
"It's the 7th anniversary of the #AffordableCareAct today, and we must protect this law that's helped millions of Americans"
"VA's seniors can't afford #TrumpCare. We should be working to lower prescription drug costs for them, not unfairly increasing their premiums"
"#TrumpCare still includes the Republican Age Tax, and people in their 50s and 60s will still see costs rise significantly"
"#TrumpCare would result in an approximate $3,200 monthly premium increase for the average 64 year old"
#TrumpCare allows insurers to charge older adults 5x what they charge younger adults. This means higher costs for older Americans

I’m ready to work w/ colleagues across the aisle on a realistic budget that charts a different path &amp; helps Virginians get ahead.
And taking taxpayer dollars away from these VA priorities to pay for Pres Trump’s wall – which won’t make us safer - is not an option.
