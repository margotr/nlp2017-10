The President’s outrageous decision to decertify isolates the US from our allies &amp; increases the risk that Iran gets a nuclear bomb.
Congress should act to stop @realDonaldTrump from following through on his threat to burn our health insurance system to the ground.

The Trump Administration has failed to get rid of ISDS - the corporate courts in NAFTA that give big businesses their own special rights.
"Despite promising to fix NAFTA's problems, @realDonaldTrump &amp; his Admin have failed to fight for workers through the first 3 rounds."
The fundamental problem with NAFTA is simple: the agreement doesn't work for American workers.
The American public deserve answers about what went wrong at @Equifax and what the company plans to do going forward.

Congress should pass our student loan servicer bill to ensure @usedgov never heads in the wrong direction again. 
We must keep watching @usedgov to make sure its decisions are good for the millions of struggling federal student loan borrowers.
Today @usedgov announced it will reverse its single loan servicer plan – &amp; I’m glad that they’re changing course. 
"I worked w/ @RoyBlunt, @SenatorShaheen &amp; @SenatorLankford on a bill to stop @usedgov’s terrible loan servicer plan. "
In June we sent a letter to @BetsyDeVosED with concerns that a single servicer would make an unaccountable monopoly.

"The nightmare is over, at least for now."
"“Skinny repeal” is reckless, cruel &amp; immoral. If the @SenateGOP pass this bill, they'll show they just don’t care about American families."
Only in the GOP alternative upside down reality can you hate a bill so much that you’re going to vote for it.
"Here’s what you learn in “How to be a Senator 101”: If you support a bill, you vote yes. If you don’t, you vote no."
"Mark my words: If the GOP can’t get a deal in committee that destroys the ACA even more, “skinny repeal” will become the law of the land."
"If the @SenateGOP wanted a bill they could fix in committee, it could’ve been blank piece of paper. They CHOSE to intro this malicious bill."
And here’s the worst part: The @SenateGOP knows this bill is appalling. One senator called it “a disaster.” “The dumbest thing in history.”
CBO says this latest garbage bill will lead to 16 MILLION more uninsured. 
This @SenateGOP bill they’re voting on tonight kills a part of the ACA key to keeping insurance affordable for everyone.
"From what I can tell, “skinny repeal” just means gutting important parts of the Affordable Care Act."
"So here’s the deal: In the dead of night tonight, the @SenateGOP will try to pass a “skinny repeal” of health care."
The @SenateGOP “skinny bill” is here and it’s exactly as wretched as we thought it’d be. 
"""C’mon, @SenateGOP. Pass a terrible 'skinny repeal' of health care &amp; we'll 'fix it' in committee!” ?!? "
Health care for millions of Americans hangs in the balance and it will all unfold tonight. Here’s what’s happening: 
The American people don’t think that guaranteed health care is a joke. I look forward to the @SenateGOP learning that lesson.
The @SenateGOP thinks guaranteed health care is all a big joke. They’re using it as a cynical ploy to play political football.
".@SenSanders is correct: Health care is a right, not a privilege. We have a moral obligation to make sure everyone has access to it."

"If the Senate passes ""skinny repeal"" then the @GOP will go into a back room to ""compromise"" between 15M and 23M people losing health care."
"And ""skinny repeal"" would likely result in at least 15 MILLION people losing health insurance. "
"If the Senate passes ""skinny repeal"" – which guts the marketplace – premiums will skyrocket. Insurers will quit."
"Senators can hide their final health care bill from the public, but they can't hide from the consequences of their votes."
.@SenateDems will vote to protect Planned Parenthood – and we will vote down this terrible proposal.
These next votes are on “repeal and run” of the Affordable Care Act – with a ban on Planned Parenthood funding thrown in for kicks.
This morning @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s second attempt at ripping health care away from millions of people.
".@realDonaldTrump can pretend this is a military decision, but it isn't. Banning troops on gender identity is shameful &amp; makes us less safe."
"By attacking thousands of troops, @realDonaldTrump makes clear that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness."
The only thing – only thing – that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job.
This vote will be the first of many @SenateGOP failures. We're doing everything we can to defend the health care of millions of Americans.
"In addition to being cruel, this first @SenateGOP proposal violates the Budget Act, so it needs 60 votes. It won't get them."
Tonight @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s first attempt at ripping health care away from millions.

"Instead of helping workers, the GOP will vote today to make it easier for companies that hurt workers to get massive gov contracts."
My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws. 
The US gov pays billions to federal contractors – but some of the biggest corporations underpay workers &amp; put their health/safety at risk.
Read the article @ChuckGrassley &amp; I wrote about our over-the-counter hearing aid bill in @JAMAInternalMed: 
".@ChuckGrassley &amp; I have a bipartisan bill to let some hearing aids be sold over-the-counter, saving families money &amp; reducing regulations."
Met this morning with the terrific staff of Lynn Community Health Center. Their patients need the ACA for insurance… 
""
"When we’re #fightingforfamilies loud enough person-to-person, city-to-city, state-to-state, then DC can’t ignore these issues any longer."
"And while the GOP continues to block #equalpay for equal work, state lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies."
Businesses that cheat their workers must be held accountable. State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.
A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. State lawmakers across the country are #fightingforfamilies with bills to expand overtime.
And Massachusetts continues to lead the way in #fightingforfamilies with earned sick time &amp; the highest state minimum wage in the country.
Massachusetts has shown that #fightingforfamilies can start in states. We did it with marriage equality &amp; health care reform.
".@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP leadership aren’t #fightingforfamilies with policies like raising the min wage, overtime pay or fair scheduling."
And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions – who should have never been confirmed in the first place – to resign. We need it now.
"We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia."
This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a very real &amp; serious threat to the national security of the United States.
Now Jeff Sessions is AG – the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign &amp; Russia? What a farce.
Jeff Sessions answered “No.” Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.
"It's a simple q: ""Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"""
I'd like for you to meet my guest to the #Jointsession speech tonight: @UMassD student &amp; Iraqi refugee Tiba Faraj. 
I can name a zillion reasons why MA is the best – but our schools &amp; health care are two very good reasons. Go MA! 
"For any and all these reasons, today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov. "
"Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia, serious business conflicts, &amp; a history of cheating people out of their homes."
.@CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.
.@SenMarkey &amp; I wrote to 17 agencies about whether they’ll use Trump’s order to cut off funding for MA services. 
MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal funds. But that money is at risk because of @realDonaldTrump’s order on local immigrants.
Heading to the Senate floor now to urge my colleagues to reject Wilbur Ross’s nomination for @CommerceGov. Watch: 
Every R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.
"Considering how obsessed @GOP are with emails, I'd hope they'd vote to extend debate on Pruitt until we can see his secret Big Oil ones."
".@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm, @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate."
".@EPA nominee Scott Pruitt wouldn't provide his office's records of dealings with Big Oil, so a court ruled he must release them next week."
I’m speaking on the Senate floor now to strong oppose Scott Pruitt to run the @EPA. Watch: 
"In the choice between corporate polluters &amp; people who want to breathe the air &amp; drink the water, Scott Pruitt sides with the polluters."
Those emails might show corruption - so of course Republicans are jamming his confirmation through 4 days before the emails become public.
"A few hours ago, a judge in OK ordered the release of thousands of emails on @EPA nominee Scott Pruitt's relationship with Big Oil."
This morning I joined 100s of workers who fought their hearts out to stop Andrew Puzder’s @USDOL nomination. Some d… 
My friend &amp; colleague @SenKamalaHarris has a new Senate twitter account! Follow her now to join our fight. 
Glad to meet with presidents &amp; trustees of MA community colleges to discuss ways the fed gov can support our school… 
Heading to the floor now to call on Puzder to withdraw &amp; urge my colleagues to vote no on Mulvaney for OMB. Watch: 
"Reports say that Andy Puzder is tired &amp; may withdraw his @USDOL nomination. If he can’t stand the heat, he should get out of the kitchen."
"And on Monday, I sent Andy Puzder 28 pages of questions about his readiness to protect America’s workers. "
We detailed more stories from Andy Puzder’s mistreated workers in a report two weeks ago: 
We heard the stories of workers mistreated by Andy Puzder’s burger chains at a @SenateDems forum last month: 
.@realDonaldTrump ’s nominee for @USDOL - @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andy Puzder – has made his fortune treating workers with total contempt.
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP should stop these reckless actions to hurt the ACA before they hurt even more people who need health coverage.
"When you shut down ads, fewer people sign up. Now Humana is pulling out of the exchanges. They don’t have enough healthy young ppl enrolled."
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have worked around the clock to sabotage health care: A vague ACA order. Repeal &amp; run. Pull the enrollment ads.
"Congress must pull its head out of the sand and launch a real, bipartisan, transparent inquiry into Russia. Our natl security is at stake."
When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?
"This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin’s dealings with Russia, both before &amp; after the election."
.@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas &amp; may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won’t release his taxes.
.@StateDept Sec Rex Tillerson has close ties to Putin. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross has close financial ties to Putin buddies.
Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.
This isn’t a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.
But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.
Michael Flynn’s blinding religious hatred &amp; shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.
I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
"If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?"
Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St’s influence.
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch at the @WhiteHouse.
.@realDonaldTrump said he’d be tough on Wall Street. That’s a broken promise. #TrumpsBrokenPromises 
"On Friday, the Senate unanimously passed my resolution congratulating the @Patriots on their Super Bowl victory. Go… "
""
I sent Andrew Puzder a 28-pg letter (83 q’s) about his readiness for @USDOL to protect America’s workers.… 
Puzder’s company has the most discrimination suits of any major burger chain – the same laws he’d be charged with enforcing at @USDOL.
.@CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andrew Puzder made a fortune squeezing his workers – the same workers he’d be charged with protecting at @USDOL.
.@SenSchumer’s concerns about Judge Gorsuch should worry everyone who cares about the independence of our courts. 
I’m speaking on the Sen floor now to urge my colleagues to vote NO on Steve Mnuchin's @USTreasury nomination. 
There’s nothing in Steve Mnuchin’s record to suggest he could stand up to Wall Street – or that he’d even want to stand up to Wall Street.
Consider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.
"And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too."
"If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us."
"If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us."
There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.
"Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have."
Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.
I’m deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight.
.@AntiochCollege's Coretta Scott King Center is right: Mrs. King’s words about Sessions should be heard. Thank you. 
Thank you @SenSanders for reading Coretta Scott King's letter on the Senate floor. It is powerfully important. 
"THANK YOU to the police, clerks, stenographers, cloakroom staff, pages, &amp; Sen officers who worked all night while @SenateDems #holdthefloor."
"Still banned from floor, but spoke w/ civil rights leaders this AM to say: Coretta Scott King will not be silenced. "
Thank you @SenSherrodBrown. Coretta Scott King will not be silenced. 
Many thanks to @SenatorTomUdall for reading Coretta Scott King’s letter on the Senate floor. 
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for bringing Coretta Scott King’s words back to the US Senate. 
Tonight @SenateMajLdr silenced Mrs King's voice on the Sen floor - &amp; millions who are afraid &amp; appalled by what's happening in our country.
I will not be silent while the Republicans rubber stamp an AG who will never stand up to the @POTUS when he breaks the law.
I will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory &amp; racist comments that have no place in our justice system.
I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. 
"On the floor, I read a letter that Coretta Scott King wrote in 1986 opposing @SenatorSessions's judicial nomination: "
"Tonight on the Senate floor, I tried to speak about why @SenatorSessions is totally unfit to serve as Attorney General."
Heading to the floor to ask: where are the senators who will say no to @SenatorSessions for AG? Watch: 
.@SenateDems are once again going to #holdthefloor all night – this time to speak out against @SenatorSessions’s nomination for AG.
.@realDonaldTrump should listen to companies and to consumers and stop financial adviser conflicts costing savers $17 billion a year.
I asked leading financial firms about @USDOL's rule. They told me: it’s good for families &amp; they’re ready to comply: 
.@POTUS’s executive order threatens to delay the new @USDOL rule requiring retirement advisers to act in their clients’ best interests.
.@USDOL Secretary nominee &amp; fast food CEO Andy Puzder built a career squeezing workers. Read one employee's story: 
".@paulkrugman is right: there's nothing ""populist"" about @realDonaldTrump's giveaways to financial predators. "
We'll keep fighting until the refugee &amp; #MuslimBan is permanently overturned. #NoBanNoWall
Relieved that there's a nationwide stay of @realDonaldTrump's illegal &amp; immoral executive order. #NoBanNoWall 
"The Wall St bankers may be popping champagne, but Americans haven't forgotten the 2008 financial crisis – and they won't forget today."
And @realDonaldTrump issued an order that puts 2 @GoldmanSachs execs in charge of gutting the rules that protect you from financial fraud.
"After literally standing next to Wall St CEOs, @realDonaldTrump made it easier for investment advisors to cheat you out of your savings."
".@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St during his campaign – but as @POTUS, we're finding out whose side he's really on."
Tonight I urged my Senate colleagues to vote no on this morally bankrupt giveaway to @exxonmobil: 
Rex Tillerson lobbied against the rule for @exxonmobil to disclose payments to foreign govs because it hurt their business with Russia.
"The same day the Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson, the @HouseGOP passed a resolution to help @exxonmobil secretly funnel money to dictators."
Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss how the @GOP is helping @exxonmobil secretly pay off dictators. Watch: 
Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I oppose Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Watch: 
"If you’re going to #draintheswamp, prove it, @SenateGOP. Protecting 2 men who lied during their job applications isn’t the way to start."
"This isn’t a game, @SenateGOP. The safety of our economy &amp; health of our people could be in the hands of 2 men who lied to the US Senate."
"This morning, the @SenateGOP unilaterally changed the committee rules to ram through Price &amp; Mnuchin without a single Democrat present."
".@SenateDems insisted: no vote on these nominees until we bring them back in to explain why they lied. Perfectly reasonable, right?"
.@HHSGov nom Price lied to the Senate about a sweetheart stock deal. @USTreasury nom Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal foreclosures.
I strongly oppose Rex Tillerson’s nomination for SecState &amp; will vote against his confirmation today. Here’s why. 
"Given what's happening, Rex Tillerson's extensive Russia ties mean we cannot trust him to be a strong advocate for America's interests."
I wish things were normal. But there is NOTHING NORMAL about this @POTUS and his Administration’s disturbing relationship with Russia.
"No, @realDonaldTrump, your illegal, unconstitutional, immoral Muslim ban is not about keeping us safe at all. "
"Based on the long and well-established record of Judge Neil Gorsuch, I will oppose his nomination. "
Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss why I will be voting NO on Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State. Watch: 
It’s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.
Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
"Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law."
"Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation’s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order."
"Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump’s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her."
Watch live now as I speak out from the Senate floor about @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban: 
I’ll also be sharing the views of nonpartisan experts who are alarmed that this policy will harm our national security. #NoBanNoWall
I’ll be sharing stories from people in MA terrified about what @realDonaldTrump’s executive action means for their loved ones. #NoBanNoWall
Tonight @SenateDems will hold the floor as we speak out against @realDonaldTrump’s illegal &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban. #NoBanNoWall
What a view tonight in front of the Supreme Court as Congressional Dems &amp; hundreds of people gathered to say… 
I urge my colleagues: vote NO on Steve Mnuchin. Don’t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying Wall St insider.
Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.
"If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic, he’d deny ever hitting the iceberg."
"You have to wonder, @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?"
Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal tactics in response to @SenBobCasey's q's. There’s no other way to say it. 
.@SenateDems brought victims of Mnuchin’s bank to DC when @GOPSenFinance refused to hear their stories. 
Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that aggressively &amp; sometimes illegally foreclosed on more than 60k families. That’s not up for debate. It’s fact.

We will not allow a Muslim ban in the United States of America. Here's what I said at Logan Airport tonight.… 
Tonight we fight for American values at airports all across this country. I'm at Logan Airport now to say: #nomuslimban #NoBanNoWall
I urge @realDonaldTrump: embrace policies that reflect America’s core values &amp; protect our ntl security. Rescind this executive order now.
"On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember what can happen when hatred &amp; fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need."
Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.
"The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, &amp; college students who sought safety from terrorists."
"We are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity."
.@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.
Let’s be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.
"Today, @realDonaldTrump closed the door on that little girl – &amp; so many others who are running for their lives."
I thought about what horrors must have possessed her parents to hand a wad of cash &amp; their little girl over to human smugglers.
And I met a 7-yr-old girl – younger than my own granddaughters – who had been sent out on that perilous journey alo…

"15 months ago, I traveled to the Greek island of Lesvos – the 1st stop for many Syrian refugees as they flee the te… "
It’s hard to imagine a less qualified or more dangerous @USedgov nominee. The Senate should reject Betsy DeVos. 
"I’ve heard from thousands of teachers, parents, &amp; ed leaders in MA with deep concerns about Betsy DeVos. I hear &amp; share their concerns."
And Betsy DeVos is unwilling to commit to be a cop on the beat with for-profit colleges that break the law &amp; cheat students.
Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.
I will vote against Betsy DeVos’s nomination for @USedgov because it’s not in the best interests of America’s young people.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions today show an ugly indifference to immigrants &amp; a profound misunderstanding of the real dangers we face.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will divert local police dept resources away from protecting &amp; building trust in our communities.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will waste taxpayer dollars on irresponsible &amp; misguided pet political projects.
".@realDonaldTrump’s actions will hurt working parents &amp; children who have risked their lives to flee war, violence &amp; poverty."
None of @realDonaldTrump’s actions today will make us safer. They’ll tear apart the fabric that makes us strong &amp; united.
Why not just declare January 25th as the Trump Administration's First Anti-Immigrant Day?
I’ve heard from many people about my vote for Dr. Ben Carson – so I’ve explained it the best I can: 
"If @RepMickMulvaney thinks the @CFPB is a ""sad, sick joke,"" maybe he should spend more time talking to his constituents"
Those are just some of the dozens of constituents – including servicemembers &amp; seniors – who have gotten money back or other help from @CFPB
Maybe @RepMickMulvaney should take a look at some of the complaints his constituents have filed with the @CFPB: 
"Budget Director nominee @RepMickMulvaney said today he believes the @CFPB is a “sad, sick joke” and that he finds the agency “offensive”"
I’m glad the @CFPB is cleaning up student loan servicing and holding @Navient accountable. That’s why we need a strong consumer agency.
There’s a reason why @Navient usually scores dead last in every @usedgov borrower satisfaction survey.
"Every time I tweet or post about @Navient, students and families share stories about how they were harmed by this student loan giant."
We all know @Navient has been caught red-handed cheating students and servicemembers before. 
Now the CEO of @Navient is whining to @washingtonpost about getting caught by the @CFPB. Give me a break. 
"Last week, @CFPB, @ILAttyGeneral, &amp; @AGOWA all sued @Navient (fmr Sallie Mae) for cheating students. "
"Perhaps @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP didn’t get the message Saturday: We’re not taking women’s rights back – not now, &amp; not ever."
I’ve been a cosponsor of a bill to repeal the global gag rule. I’ll be 1st in line to cosponsor again when @SenatorShaheen reintroduces it.
.@POTUS Trump is reinstating the “global gag rule” to stop funding for overseas health centers that may provide abortion. This is insanity.
Attacking @PPFA &amp; US women’s reproductive rights isn’t enough for @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP. Today they made their fight global.
"We must measure @POTUS @realDonaldTrump by actions, not only words. And today he made it harder for families to achieve the American Dream."
"That’s 40,000 families who just lost their chance to buy a home thanks to brand-new @POTUS @realDonaldTrump."
".@POTUS suspended a planned cut in FHA mortgage insurance premiums, which @nardotrealtor says will cost 40k families a shot at a new home."
