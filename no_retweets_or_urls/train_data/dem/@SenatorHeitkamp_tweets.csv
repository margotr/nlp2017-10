Here’s my full statement on the president withdrawing from the Paris climate accord: 
Must acknowledge reality that all countries—including US—must reduce emissions while maintaining strong future 4 fossil fuels &amp; renewables
U.S. can’t remain an energy leader if we aren’t even at the negotiating table.
"No agreement is perfect, and adjusting our commitments or timetable would have been viable avenues to pursue."
Abandoning Paris climate accord is a reckless decision that forfeits an oppty to guarantee a viable future for ND energy on the global level

"But here’s the kicker: the Republican health care bill would do all of this while giving individuals making $200,000+ a tax cut."
"Biggest savings from GOP health care bill comes from $830B in cuts to Medicaid - a program 90,000+ NDans rely on for quality/affordable care"
GOP health care bill would disproportionately hurt those in rural communities who rely on rural health clinics &amp; hospitals for coverage
"It would also make coverage unaffordable for the 300,000+ North Dakotans w/pre-existing conditions like asthma, cancer, or being pregnant."
"The Republican health care bill would rip away health care from 23 million Americans by 2026, including more than 28,000 North Dakotans."
