My full statement on bipartisan agreement to fix Affordable Care Act: 
@POTUS Glad federal judge has blocked @POTUS latest travel ban bc barring ppl from USA solely on where they’re from… 
"@POTUS And make no mistake, President Trump's third travel ban remains discriminatory, short-sighted, and completely unacceptable."
"I strongly opposed @POTUS' previous two travel bans bc they were poorly thought out, poorly executed, and above all, would hurt Minnesotans."
"@senorrinhatch Yesterday, the bill passed in the Senate &amp; I’ll work hard to get it passed in the House &amp; signed int… "
.@senorrinhatch &amp; I wrote a bipartisan bill to provide orgs working w/ vulnerable populations access to FBI fingerprint background checks.
We should give organizations that look after our loved ones the tools they need to make sure that their staff &amp; volunteers are trustworthy.
"When we leave our children, the elderly, and people with disabilities in the care of others, we need to know that they are in good hands."

"@CommerceGov I was glad to keep this fight going today with two of my Minnesota Congressional colleagues, @amyklobuchar and @USRepRickNolan."
That’s what I told the @CommerceGov in June when I first backed an investigation into the threat of foreign steel to our national security.
I believe foreign steel dumping makes it harder for America to build equipment that affects national security. 
"I'm asking @FAFNorwalk to make companies publicly disclose income, assets, and taxes paid, among other things, on c… "
Better disclosure will help the public and investors know more about tax practices of big companies.
It’s alarming that some large American companies are able to take advantage of tax havens to dodge U.S. tax rules.
I believe the public has the right to know what countries large companies pay (or don’t pay) taxes in.
#CleanEnergy job growth in Minnesota is skyrocketing. Wind and solar jobs grew by 16% in a single year. More here:

"We need to make our voices heard because this is terrible for women’s health, equality, and economic security. "
"Thanks to the ACA, 62 million women in the country now have coverage for birth control &amp; other preventive services w/o out-of-pocket costs."
Access to birth control affects decisions women make every day—like whether to start a new job or how much a family can save for college.
"But today, the Trump Administration announced it will give employers the power to deny women birth control coverage."
It’s 2017. It shouldn’t be up for debate that women deserve to make their own health care decisions for themselves and families.

"#Cleanenergy now employs 57,000+ Minnesotans. Between ’15 &amp; ’16, the industry grew at an extremely fast rate."
"Minnesota is a leader in #cleanenergy, which drives economic growth throughout our state and protects the planet."
Thank you Eliot Seide for your leadership at @afscmemn5 and for all you have done for working families in Minnesota.
"When MN communities can access high-speed internet, students do better, businesses grow, health care improves, and families stay connected."
I’m glad to see this new investment. Deploying high-speed broadband to more rural and tribal areas of Minnesota is a huge priority of mine.
"Congrats to Fond du Lac Band on its #FiberToTheHome initiative, an investment to provide 900+ homes with broadband."
Happy to share that my office is accepting applications for our high school internship program for grades 11 &amp; 12. 
I'm glad to see @mnhealth effort (made possible by @CDCgov) to combat #opioidcrisis through data. More info here: 
I’m committed to addressing the opioid crisis across our nation because we owe it to people like Sharon from Minnesota to tackle this issue.
"Recently, I met w/ group in Olmsted County. Sharon was among attendees &amp; bravely shared story of losing her daughter Rachael to opioid use."
"Across MN, I've met w/ officials, health care and community service providers, and law enforcement learning about effects of opioid crisis."
I strongly urge all who are in path of the storm to closely follow latest alerts and to take care of your families. 
"We also owe a big thanks to the workers, officials, and volunteers who are preparing to keep Americans safe if Irma hits the mainland."
Thank you to all of the emergency responders who are already working tirelessly to help folks affected by #HurricaneIrma.
"My measure will support rural jobs, play critical role in cutting energy costs, and help farmers and producers invest in #energy efficiency."
"I’ve offered blueprint for energy section of new #FarmBill bc I want to stand up for farmers, producers, and rural biz in MN and our nation."
"As we craft 2018 Farm Bill in Congress, I’m fighting to make sure MN's ag priorities are being heard—&amp; that’s why I intro'd my energy bill."
"In Minnesota, one-in-five jobs is tied to agriculture, which means that the economic health of our entire state depends on farming."
"Each and every day, our nation’s farmers have our backs. I believe we need to have
theirs as well."
Today I met with Gateway Corridor Commission’s @GoldLineB

(50) the number of Republican Senators who will own this travesty of a bill if it passes.
(7) the number of years that Republicans spent undercutting the #ACA while doing nothing to write their own viable health bill.

Let's break down some numbers behind this so-called Republican #SkinnyPlan.

Read my full statement in reaction to former FBI Director James Comey's testimony before the Senate Intel Committee: 
President Trump wants American people &amp; Congress to let this thing go. That’s not an option when the integrity of our democracy is at stake.
Now more than ever we should be encouraged that there’s special prosecutor to get to bottom of what happened bt Trump’s team &amp; the Russians.
Former Director Comey's testimony makes the case even stronger that the President has continuously tried to undermine that investigation.
It’s clear that President Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey because of the Trump-Russia investigation. #ComeyHearing

MN is one of 10 states with the greatest increase in % of children covered by #Medicaid in rural areas in the years after ACA’s passage.
Medicaid is a lifeline for rural communities in MN and our nation. It's unacceptable that the GOP health care bill would gut the program.
"Given that so many of my constituents live in small towns &amp; frontier areas, &amp; on farms &amp; reservations, rural health care is a top priority."
Nearly 62 million people in our country—one in five Americans—live in rural areas. 1.2 million in Minnesota alone.
