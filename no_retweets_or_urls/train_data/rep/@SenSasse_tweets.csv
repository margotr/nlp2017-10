Senators from both parties should be deeply skeptical of any changes that centralize power. 
Don't abandon the filibuster - embrace the Founders' vision of serious debate as a bulwark against unlimited gov't. 
The 3 most consequential moments in the growth of fed power in the past century show why we need the filibuster: 
Any short-term political gain from undoing the filibuster comes at long-term expense. Here's why:

What President Trump would teach us about Congress's sophomoric views on executive power: 
The problem of a weak Congress and executive growth should be bad news to all of us. 
People grow cynical when it’s nearly impossible to throw the bums out. The people are in charge - they should be able to do the firing. #XU
"Legislators can be fired – that’s what elections are for – but bureaucrats, who have the actual power, can't be fired. #XU"
The Founders’ design for checks &amp; balances was &amp; is a good idea. Those in power will always try to grab more power—that has not changed. #XU
"The weakness of the Congress is not just undesirable, but is actually a dangerous thing for America. #XU"
"For partisans, it’s easy to forgive a President who oversteps his authority— so long as your guy is the one in charge.​ #XU"

Reducing polarization =/= watering down conviction. Quite the contrary. 
Such executive overreach came about because of a great deal of symbiotic legislative underreach. 
Everything cannot be simply Republicans versus Democrats. 
We need to pause to regularly recall the larger American principles that bind us together.

"My team looks forward to serving you, and we hope this redesigned website will help. Check it out: "
This should set the table for a serious conversation: 
A small but encouraging sign that Congress is waking up to the reality that #cybersecurity is national security: 
Americans deserve a complete &amp; transparent accounting of the systematic failures of ACA's CO-OP program. 
No answers on co-op failure? No nominees to #HHS. 
Rs&amp;Ds from these 9 states have a bipartisan opportunity to demand answers for our constituents—so this kind of failure never happens again.
"Co-ops have failed in CO, OR, TN, KY, IA, NY, NV, LA—and Nebraska. To date, 8 of the original 23 co-ops have failed. "
I will block consideration &amp; confirmation of every HHS nominee until families who lost their co-op insurance plans get straight answers.
Hundreds of thousands lost their plans when co-ops in 9 states collapsed. The bureaucrats who oversaw this mess owe victims answers.

It's way past time we consider individual appropriations bills &amp; have a serious conversation w/the American people. 
I am committed to defunding Planned Parenthood &amp; restoring Congress' constitutional power of the purse thru a real debate about priorities.
This city stumbles from crisis to crisis by short-term budgeting. And that's no way to run a bait shop - let alone the federal government.
"Washington's false choice between ""fund it all"" or ""shut the government down"" is nonsense. I reject it. "
And we have no reason to believe that this is even the full story on #OPMhack. 
Washington assumes the American people are too stupid or preoccupied to care about cybersecurity. Not after #OPMhack 
5.6 million: 
This admin treats #OPMhack as a PR crisis instead of a #natsec threat. Case in point? Today's blatant news dump.

The SSA says we have 18 years until #SocialSecurity’s reserves dry up. This report indicates we have even less time than that.
The SSA is a black box: only the #SocialSecurity trustees (not even Congress!) know the real data or the methodologies used.
"What's more: the SSA doesn’t publish its data, so this new study can’t give us a number of how off our #SocialSecurity estimates might be."
"Essentially, we’ve had fewer babies &amp; fewer funerals than SSA estimated, which gives a very different picture of #SocialSecurity solvency."
"Since 2000, #SocialSecurity forecasts showed a rosier picture to Congress, providing false comfort &amp; misleading by a wider margin each year."
Their new Harvard-Dartmouth study checked the accuracy of ~30 years of #SocialSecurity forecasts &amp; it might be worse than we thought.
Kudos to @kinggary @kostyakashin &amp; Dr Soneji for an important analysis. We need to know the hard facts about #SocialSecurity’s health.

#Iran has 19K centrifuges. POTUS said he'd concede 1K &amp; is now up to conceding 6K. The right # is zero &amp; that’s what we should fight for.

Marrying the tax code's complexity to #Obamacare's complexity will make this a challenging year for the #IRS-&amp; all Americans. #TaxDay
"Current #IRS estimates for telephone wait times? Almost 30 minutes, thanks to the redirection of funds from #Obamacare. #TaxDay"
And don't expect help on the phone - $100 million of the #IRS's telephone support budget was redirected to #Obamacare compliance. #TaxDay
"Who's in charge of this massive new #ACA compliance? No one in particular at the IRS, according to IRS commissioner (except for him) #TaxDay"
"And now the #IRS is in charge of implementing 34 provisions of #Obamacare for the 1st time this year, on top of that complexity. #TaxDay"
How complex is the tax code? 91% of Americans use software to do their taxes. #TaxDay

Senator Sasse is back in Nebraska after an eight-day trip to the Middle East. Here’s what he saw there: 
I’m hopeful that my colleagues &amp; I are just beginning a conversation about the things Nebraskans regard as the most important duties of govt
It's not a perfect budget—I would've preferred more urgency in fixing Washington’s broken entitlement &amp; poverty programs—but it is a roadmap
"The Senate budget offers a roadmap to tackle Washington’s runaway spending, set long-term priorities &amp; start working on entitlement reform."
"We have a reason to be prudently optimistic: for the 1st time in years, Congress has an opportunity to pass a budget that leads to balance."

Talking w/@NECattlemen before passing an amdt w/@SenJohnBarrasso that helps producers reign in #WOTUS overregulation 
Congress should scrap this #SGR deal and work on a new solution. Americans deserve more than smoke &amp; mirrors. #docfix 
"Additionally, this #SGR deal fails the budget common sense test. The magical “alternative fiscal baseline” won't hold "
And how many have read the 263pg #SGR bill? We know what happens when Congress passes a bill to find out what’s in it 
"Plus, the #SGR proposal saddles taxpayers &amp; their grandkids with $141 billion over just the first decade. "
"This bill relies on command &amp; control bureaucracy, substituting the flawed #SGR formula for &gt;120 pages of new rules "
The House bill is a missed opportunity to fix #Medicare &amp; arguably makes our long-term problems worse. #SGR

Taxpayer dollars spent on the #AmnestyBonus? Congress has a duty to hold the Administration accountable for this. 
One estimate: those approved for the new #amnesty will file $2 bil of claims for the EITC over the next 5 years --&gt; 
How many of the 90K beneficiaries of the president's executive #amnesty will receive an #AmnestyBonus of taxpayer $? 
90K have signed up for SSNs thru the president's executive #amnesty - and we only have the numbers thru Jan 2013.

“There’s a lot of great Americans working for hard for us in the CBP…but we don’t have a secure border.” 
Getting serious about securing our border starts by honestly assessing the challenges we face 
Ben spent the weekend on a fact-finding tour of our southern border. More of what he saw: 
"By subsidizing illegal entry with an #amnesty bonus, the #IRS would promote lawlessness. "
"POTUS’s exec actions will not only allow illegal aliens to stay in the country, but would also award them w/federal $ "
Does the president's executive action include #amnesty bonuses? Uh oh:
