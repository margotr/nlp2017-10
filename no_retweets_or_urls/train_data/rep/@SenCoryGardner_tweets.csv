I hope a future Administration reverses this dangerous course &amp; puts the Iranian regime under pressure necessary to truly change behavior.
"Iran has funded terror. Iran will continue to fund terror. Now, however, they have billions more to do it with."
Soleimani is responsible for supplying IEDs to Iraqi insurgents to kill Americans.
"Notably, Iran recently violated U.N. travel restrictions by sending abroad Qassem Soleimani, a known terrorist &amp; Iranian General."
"Just since this deal was announced, Iran has conducted multiple illegal ballistic missile tests. They've held American sailors at gunpoint."
The Administration seems convinced that endless concessions to Iran will provoke a behavior change. That has proven to be laughably false.
Groups funded by Iran have killed innocents in Syria. They've killed Israelis. They've killed Americans.
Many of us warned money released to the Iranian regime would fund terror. Sec. Kerry has now admitted as much.

Watch my full exchange with @AmbassadorPower on the Obama Administration's lacking response to Iranian belligerence: 
'Obama's UN envoy grilled on Iranian missile tests' The Administration's lack of action on this is unacceptable.
".@POTUS has signed the Every Student Succeeds Act, a major overhaul of education policy: "
The Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee is holding a hearing on terrorism &amp; global oil markets. Watch live: 
Every Student Succeeds Act makes progress towards getting Congress out of the classroom &amp; rolling back Common Core: 
The passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act represents a step forward in federal education policy: 
"If the Administration won't respond to an illegal ballistic missile test, how can we trust that they can hold Iran to a nuclear deal? (4/4)"
"That's no response at all, and it's totally unacceptable. (3/4)"
".@AmbassadorPower responded that the Administration has ""increased the political cost to Iran"" by talking about the issue at the U.N. (2/4)"
"At a Foreign Relations hearing today, I asked @AmbassadorPower for the Administration's response to Iran testing a ballistic missile. (1/4)"
It’s time for the Administration to respond to Iranian belligerence. Inaction is no longer an option. 
"Given recent behavior, I have no confidence that Iran will abide by the terms of the nuclear deal. "
We were told to trust the Obama Admin. could hold Iran accountable. But their engagement policy with Iran proving to be dangerous farce.
Obama Admin has been stunningly indifferent. Iran violated UN travel sanctions (Gen. Soleimani). Violated ballistic missile test ban.
"We warned Iran would take sanctions relief and build up their arsenal, prop up Assad, &amp; arm terror groups. They've done exactly that."
"When @POTUS was pursuing his misguided nuclear deal, many of us warned that Iran would cheat. Happening already. "
