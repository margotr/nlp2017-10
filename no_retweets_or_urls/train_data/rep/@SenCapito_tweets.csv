"For the good of the nation &amp; for the good of the Senate, there should be no filibuster of Judge Gorsuch."
I hope my Dem colleagues will recognize the need to invoke cloture on Judge Gorsuch’s nomination.
Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge who has earned the respect of his judicial colleagues.
The Senate has a very clear history of rejecting the use of the filibuster against #SCOTUS nominations.
A filibuster of a nominee like Judge Gorsuch would be a tremendous mistake &amp; would harm the Senate as an institution.
.@TheJournalWV echoed these words saying Judge Gorsuch will decide cases regardless of his own preferences
".@IntelligencerWV editorial highlights that Judge Gorsuch is faithful to the #Constitution, not ideology."
Recent @DM_opinion editorial supports Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation &amp; believes he has the strong understanding &amp; respect for our Constitution
"It’s clear from our mtg, a thorough examination of his record &amp; watching last wks hearing, that Judge Gorsuch will rule fairly."
Judge Gorsuch has been through the Senate confirmation process before when he was approved to the 10th circuit w/out opposition.
Judge Scalia left behind a legacy of faithfully applying the law &amp; Judge Gorsuch is a worthy successor.

.@POTUS listened to WV miners &amp; others who struggled. He is making good on his promise and putting them back to work.
.@POTUS' action today is a refreshing change &amp; a promise kept to roll back the #CPP - 1 of the most harmful acts of overreach by Obama admin
"Unfortunately President Obama vetoed our measures to protect affordable, reliable energy &amp; jobs from the #CleanPowerPlan's overreach"
"Last year, I led the charge in the Senate along w/ @SenateMajLdr to overturn harmful #CleanPowerPlan regs for coal power sources"
This Executive Order shows @POTUS is serious about cutting anti-coal regs &amp; reducing unnecessary obstacles for jobs &amp; energy production.
