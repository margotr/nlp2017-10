Legislation follows my investigation into #Backpage. They knowingly facilitated sex trafficking to increase profits. 
Stopping #humantrafficking is one of the great humanitarian and human rights causes of the 21st century:

Our stunning bipartisan report details what #Backpage did. Those who commit this crime must be held accountable: 
My investigation showed #Backpage knowingly facilitated criminal sex trafficking of vulnerable women &amp; young girls &amp; covered it up 4 profits
"In America, #humantrafficking has moved from the street corner to the iPhone. Sadly, thousands of young girls are trafficked every year."
Today is the UN's #EndHumanTrafficking Day. It is important for us in the US not to view this as some distant problem. It is happening here.
#TaxReform means more #jobs &amp; better wages. Congress should work together to get this done for the American people:

"#Obamacare isn’t working for #Ohio families &amp; #smallbiz, many of whom have seen premiums &amp; deductibles skyrocket:"
Here is my statement on #healthcare &amp; the need to work together to find solutions that benefit #Ohio: 
Great story about our @OHNationalGuard going above and beyond for the community they serve. 
Sanctions bill requires @StateDept to determine whether to designate #NorthKorea a state sponsor of terror. I believe they should.
"I urge @POTUS to sign these #Iran, #Russia, and #NorthKorea sanctions into law. "
My priorities to counter Russian propaganda &amp; disinfo are included in the bill &amp; send a clear signal that their actions have consequences.
"Pleased that the U.S. Congress has voted to hold #Iran, #Russia, and #NorthKorea accountable for their aggressive and destabilizing behavior"

"Important that the Senate act quickly to pass the #Russia, #Iran, #NorthKorea sanctions bill and urge #POTUS to sign it into law."
#TaxReform will give our economy a shot in the arm. I’m committed to working w/ my colleagues to get this done. #Ohio #Jobs
#TaxReform is about more #jobs &amp; better wages. Good news for #Ohio workers that progress is being made: 
I will support legislation to move this process to a House-Senate conference because I believe we need to repeal and replace Obamacare.
#NorthKorea has and is terrorizing American citizens. The U.S. must call out the NK regime for what it is. 
The NK regime terrorizes its citizens at home &amp; it exports its dangerous tech to countries like #Iran &amp; #Syria: 
I’ve made clear the @StateDept should redesignate #NorthKorea a state sponsor of terror. Via @FreeBeacon:

It is also critical that we step up efforts to hold NK responsible for their sponsor of terrorism at home &amp; abroad.

"I commend the House for passing the #Iran, #Russia, and #NorthKorea sanctions bill. The Senate should act quickly: "
I'm pleased that I have received a commitment that Senate will vote on this proposal as central part of this process.
I’m working to help low-income Americans get access to affordable health care: 
I continue to have concerns abt Medicaid policies in this bill &amp; I'll continue to work to improve this bill further:
