@rickklein All-in spend Ossoff ~$30.2M to Handel $22.7M.  WAY too much spent for one seat.
@jmartNYT @CLFSuperPAC @FP1Strategies Looks like all-in spend was ~$30M Ossoff  to ~$23M Handel.  I think… 
Handel won by 4 points in a district Trump only won by 1.5.  Ossoff raised $23M and had $8M of outside help.
