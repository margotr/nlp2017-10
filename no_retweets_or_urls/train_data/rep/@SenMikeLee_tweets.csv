“Train wreck” isn’t quite the right metaphor to describe the calamity that is the Affordable Care Act: 
"To date, half of the 23 co-ops created under #Obamacare have collapsed, despite receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies."
It’s not just patients who find #Obamacare to be too expensive. Insurance providers are coming to same conclusion: 
#Obamacare's toxic combination of rising costs and limited choices has had serious consequences for low- and middle-income Americans.
"In my home state of Utah, the residents of 20 out of the state’s 29 counties are limited to only one insurance plan under #Obamacare. #utpol"

No one seriously claims #Obamacare has made it easier or more affordable for American people to access the health care services they need.

Last night while you were sleeping the Senate voted to steal $150 billion dollars from Social Security Trust Fund: 
".@CyberMormon If you like bipartisanship, you should support a better process than the undemocratic process that produced this #BudgetDeal"
"GOP should be the party of fiscal sanity and responsible governance. But we won’t be, so long as we continue to govern by crisis and cliff."
"GOP should be the party of reform. But we won’t be, so long as individual senators are blocked from offering amendments to legislation."
"GOP should be party of ideas. But we won’t be, if we continue tolerating a legislative process that stifles our most innovative proposals."
"Only in Washington, D.C. could something so deceptive, ineffectual, and unfair be considered a “reform.” "
"Our grand, bipartisan solution to Social Security Disability Insurance insolvency = steal $150 billion from social security Trust Fund."
The #budgetdeal is the last gasping breath of a disgraced bipartisan beltway establishment on the verge of collapse:
