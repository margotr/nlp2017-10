"In the Obama years, Americans are seeing stagnant wages, poverty has grown &amp; more people are leaving the labor force."
".@POTUS claims by every economic measure we’re significantly better off than 7yrs ago. That’s simply not true:
"
The only comparison that should matter is how our current economic growth stacks up against historic American growth.
"President Obama also says at least we’re growing better than Europe. Even that isn’t true anymore: Last quarter – US: 0.5%, Europe: 2.2%."
Obama admin. defends &lt;2% growth as the “new normal.” The American people should not be satisfied with that explanation. It’s a surrender.
America was made greatest nation in world with avg. historic growth of about 3.7%. Obama administration has failed to ever even reach 3%.
Stagnant economic growth of Obama administration is an outlier among Dem &amp; Repub administrations. 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is basically the health of the American economy – a measure of opportunity available to our citizens.
