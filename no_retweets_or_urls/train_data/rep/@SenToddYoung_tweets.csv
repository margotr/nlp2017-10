@Tina46129189 And that's only in the 10 year window CBO normally scores. They say savings accumulate more rapidly in second decade.
"@Tina46129189 It adds to the debt only relative to current law, but current law has never been enforced. It's been patched 17x in 11 years."

"Happy birthday to former Hoosier Abe Lincoln, who grew up in southern Indiana just outside the 9th District. "
"Sen. Donnelly is a nice guy.  But as one of his constituents, I urge him to reconsider his position and allow debate on House bill."
He also said he's frustrated Congress isn't doing its job on immigration...but yet still votes to block Congressional debate on immigration.
"In November, Sen. Donnelly said President didn't have that authority. "
House passed simple bill to beef up border security and fund DHS--Dems are blocking just to protect President's executive actions.
