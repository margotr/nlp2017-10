Idaho has much to offer as a world leader in the energy sector. Glad to share w/ @lisamurkowski when she visits @INL: 
I could not support the massive omnibus spending bill that spends too much and borrows too much. My full statement: 
The Intel Cmte has released a report on the 2012 terrorist attack in #Benghazi. It's time to hold people accountable.

This is the time of year to look at all the good things and the blessings we have. Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays! 
I met w/ Pastor Saeed's wife @NaghmehAbedini today. His ongoing imprisonment and abuse in Iran must end. #savesaeed. 
Idaho small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Support them today and #shopsmall! #SmallBusinessSaturday
Pleased that the Senate has unanimously passed my resolution to #savesaeed. Iran should immediately release Pastor Saeed Abedini.
"How is #Obamacare affecting you and your family? If you haven't already, please share #yourstory with me. "
This morning I shared the story of an Idaho small business owner who is struggling under #Obamacare. VIDEO: 
Vicki's and my prayers go out to those affected by Typhoon Haiyan. You can donate to @RedCross relief efforts online: 
"Appears Obama admin about to make another colossal Middle East blunder in deal with Iran, making a partial and temporary agreement."
"I want to know how #Obamacare has affected you, your family, or your small business. Please share #YourStory with me: "
Looking forward to joining @ErinBurnett live on @CNN @ 5 pm MT to discuss the NSA &amp; allegations that U.S. has been spying on world leaders.

Seems D/CIA Brennan bringing back some furloughed CIA employees.  Bring them all back. See my letter to Pres. Obama: 
Sent a letter to President Obama asking him to deem all National Security personnel essential. See letter here: 
"From the start, I have voted to defund Obamacare. Tomorrow I will vote to oppose cloture and to defund this abomination."
I joined @SenTedCruz on the Senate floor earlier to voice my opposition to funding Obamacare. #MakeDClisten Video: 
Yesterday I asked yet another @StateDept official to continue the effort to #SaveSaeed. Video: 
It's been 5 years since the application to build the #KeystoneXL pipeline was submitted. It would create 42K #jobs but Obama won't approve.
I answered great questions from Idahoans last night during my telephone town hall. Listen to the recording online: 
It's not too late to sign up for the telephone town hall I will be hosting tonight. Sign up on my website:

Earlier today I held a press conference in Boise to discuss my vote against authorization of force in Syria. VIDEO: 
I questioned Sec. of State Kerry on the administration's plan for U.S. military force in Syria. Watch the video: 
Looking forward to taking questions from the audience at City Club in Idaho Falls today. 
Only one structure has been lost due to the Beaver Creek Fire. Thankful for the incredibly good work by these brave firefighters.
Went to fire camp on Beaver Creek Fire today. Met w/ commanders &amp; firefighters &amp; inspected 30+ homes miraculously saved in Greenhorn Gulch.

Another example of Boko Haram terrorizing Christians in Nigeria. When will the Obama administration take action? 
I'm glad the Senate was able to come together today on behalf of our nation's students.

In January I asked USDA to recognize Greek yogurt under nutrition guidelines. They have &amp; it will soon be served in school lunches in Idaho.
Today we celebrate 237 years as the land of the free and home of the brave. America is truly the greatest country in the world. #Happy4th
Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the 19 wildland firefighters whose lives were tragically lost in Arizona.
On one-year anniversary of #SCOTUS ruling on #ObamaCare I share concerns that the IRS's role in implementation will be politicized.
"Our country needs immigration reform. But, this bill overreaches and I did not support it. #immigration"
Moving story by Pastor Abedini’s wife on his imprisonment in Iran for his Christian beliefs. #savesaeed 
I am hopeful that #SCOTUS will uphold the lower court's ruling on Pres Obama's unconstitutional recess appointments. 
Nightforce Optics of Orofino is my #smallbizweek honoree today. Quality products purchased worldwide from a small town in Idaho. Congrats!
Western Idaho Cabinets of Boise has achieved the #americandream. From 2 people in a garage to the top cabinet maker in Idaho. #smallbizweek
Dome Technology in Idaho Falls is today's small business. @DomeOne is a great story of innovation and hard work. #smallbizweek
"As part of #SmallBizWeek, today I am pleased to recognize The Nehemian in Buhl for adding new business lines to expand &amp; thrive. #innovation"
"As part of #SmallBusiness Week, today I’m pleased to recognize Quest Aircraft in Sandpoint for their great work."

I recorded a video for @VOA_News to let the Iranians know we are watching out for Pastor Saeed Abedini. #savesaeed 
Sad 5th anniversary this week of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s capture but good news family received letter from him. Efforts continue to rescue him.
Forest Service should increase timber harvest to protect forest from catastrophic wildfire. My comments from hearing: 
Glad @NaghmehAbedini spoke before UN Human Rights Council. A powerful voice for husband &amp; other pol prisoners 
Very hopeful that @NaghmehAbedini receives support at the UN. We cannot rest until Iran lets Saeed return home. 
A lower court has ruled Obama's recess appts invalid. I joined my 44 GOP colleagues in asking SCOTUS to uphold. 
Vicki's &amp; my thoughts and prayers are w/ the brave heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the American Dream #MemorialDay
"Last week I signed onto a letter condemning the #IRSscandal for singling out certain groups,chilling political speech "
Did you see the latest news about Pastor Abedini? We must continue to push for his release. 
Congrats to @KTVB &amp; @Emjayktvb for 1st place award for story on government from @IdahoPress Club. Check it out here: 
Vicki's and my thoughts and prayers go out to the families affected by the devastating tornadoes in Oklahoma. #PrayForOklahoma
Pastor Abedini's release is important to many Idahoans. Here's my exchange w/ State Dept in case you haven't seen it: 
"Glad to see FBI and others were on top of Uzbekistan terrorism plot. It goes to show that if it can happen in Boise, it can happen anywhere."
At Small Biz Committee hearing yesterday we discussed ways to relieve small biz from potential of extreme burdens of e-verify. #4jobs
Video of my exchange with State Dept about Pastor Abedini can be viewed here:  
I talked to the State Dept about Pastor Abedini this morning. I'm encouraged by what I was told and will continue to push for his release.

#Benghazi hearings in the House provided firsthand info from people who were there. Information continues to develop on this tragedy.
"For those of you asking, I voted against the #MarketplaceFairness Act. I agree w/ the concept but want stronger protections for #smallbiz."

"Both Rs and Ds agree, Assad crossed POTUS' red line. Question now is, what will U.S. do? Either way, answer sends a strong message to Iran."
"Vicki &amp; I are proud to support @marchofdimes. We were ""chefs"" at last night's gala &amp; Vicki deserves all the credit. "
Regulations are strangling small business. I made my point at a Small Business hearing yesterday w/ #Obamacare regs. 
Thanks to @USChamber for the Spirit of Enterprise award. Reducing federal regs to help create jobs is a big priority. 
Vicki's and my heart goes out to the victims and their families in Boston as do the thoughts and prayers of Idahoans. #prayforboston
#TaxDay reminder that President Obama has added $1.7 trillion in new taxes &amp; wants to add $1.1 trillion more. Not with my vote!
Getting an early start on #Protect2A today. Talking about #2ndAmendment on @CBSThisMorning momentarily. 
Just taped CBS Evening News segment for 6:30 PM ET tonight defending legal gun ownership. #Protect2A 
Sad to hear of Lady Thatcher’s passing. Her work with Pres. Reagan changed the direction of the world during a difficult time in history.
"Dem budget raises up to $1.5 trillion in taxes, increases spending 62% and adds $7.3 T in debt. #nofiscalsanity #spendingistheproblem"
MT @MikeCrapo Do you have a story of how #EPA has negatively impacted your business or farm? Share using #IdahoEPA 
The 2nd Amendment doesn’t just protect hunting. It protects the right to keep and bear arms. #FridayFact #constitution #2ndamdt
"Senate Dems finally do a budget after 4 years. It increases taxes &amp; spending, more debt &amp; no welfare fixes. Disappointing. #CutWaste"
Pleased to join this effort 
Collaboration on sage grouse must happen. Here’s what I said in my statement at Sally Jewel hearing 
I voted no on #Brennan again today. My concerns about him as CIA director have not changed. #StandWithRand
Look forward to being on Nate Shelman's show on @KBOI670 this afternoon discussing @SenRandPaul's filibuster. #StandWithRand
"In case you missed my questions for #Brennan at the nomination hearing last month, view them here: "
Today I voted no on #Brennan. I have issues w/ handling of #Benghazi &amp; AQAP bomb plot leak. Showed poor judgment in comments to reporters.
Meeting w/ 35 groups from Idaho this week like U of I &amp; ID VA services. Always good to see Idahoans in DC – welcome to the nation’s capital!
"The Idaho Territory was created 150 years ago today by President Lincoln.  Happy Anniversary, Idaho. Video of bill:  "
"Sally Jewell is a delightful person but there are major issues to resolve, like that of sage grouse, before I can support her nomination."
Today our country has reached a troubling historic milestone. #1400days without a budget passed in the #Senate. 
I voted against the nomination of Senator #Hagel for defense secretary. He is not the right fit for this important job.
I will be appearing on @GlennBeck radio at 10:35 ET this morning. Listen live with this link: 
Am hosting a Teletown Hall tonight &amp; would like to take my 1st question via Twitter. Tweet me your question &amp; I will respond to one tonight.

Enjoyed speaking to @BoiseChamber members at today's Congressional Forum. I appreciate the chance to hear from so many Idaho job creators.
.@MarcoRubio &amp; I wrote to John Brennan demanding more info on freed Tunisian suspect from #Benghazi. We need answers. 
I enjoyed meeting with representatives of @IdahoPotato today. The Idaho trademark is for Idaho-grown spuds only! #worldsbest
Disappointed that POTUS' plan to decrease the #debt is to increase taxes. #SOTU #cutspendingnow #spendingistheproblem 
The President’s 1st term increased #debt by $6 trillion. I look forward to his #SOTU to hear how he wants to reduce it. #CutSpendingNow
ICYMI: @SenMikeLee &amp; I spoke w/ @seanhannity last night on @FoxNews about the #Brennan hearing &amp; legality of #drones. 
Will be on @FoxNews in 5 minutes to discuss today's #Brennan hearing with @seanhannity &amp; @SenMikeLee. Tune in and 
Looking forward to talking w/ @SeanHannity about today's Intel hearing tonight on @Foxnews at 9 ET/7 MT. #Brennan #CIA
It was a pleasure speaking to members of @TroutUnlimited today. Conservation issues remain important to Idahoans &amp; I appreciate TU's work.
"I recently enjoyed a day hunting in the great outdoors w/ TK Davis, John Shaw &amp; Buck Gardner. Great guys &amp; a lot of fun "
This is the 4th year in 5 the President hasn’t submitted a budget to Congress as required by law. And #NoDemBudget in Senate either.
I voted 'no' on today's debt limit vote because spending is the problem. We need to #CutSpendingNow not suspend our #DebtLimit.
I was on @FoxNews yesterday to discuss unanswered #Benghazi questions &amp; the #KeystoneXL Pipeline. VIDEO: 
The court has made the right decision by rejecting President Obama's unconstitutional recess appointments. 
Enjoyed speaking w/ @shannonbream for an @ANHQDC segment that will air Sunday between 12-2 pm ET/10-12 MT on @FoxNews 
I have signed on &amp; urge the President to approve. 
Just posted video of my questions for Sec of State Clinton from today's Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi 
"I am strongly #prolife &amp; will continue working to protect &amp; defend the life of the unborn today, the 40th anniv of #RoevWade, and every day."
"Going forward, I will continue to advocate for a gov't that allows more freedom, fewer regulations, and less spending. "
I believe the 2nd Amendment is for all law-abiding Americans &amp; increased gun control will not solve the issues facing our nation.
