"VIDEO: Alexander talks about bipartisan deal to help stabilize individual insurance markets, lower premiums: "
Going to the Senate floor at 4:15 PM ET to discuss agreement on short-term health care stabilization plan. Watch: 
I hope our witnesses here will help us understand the drug delivery system &amp; how their role in the system affects the price patients pay
"... who then pick up those drugs at 60,000 drug stores, or receive them from doctors or hospitals, and from online pharmacies. (2/2)"
More than 4.4 billion prescriptions are written for drugs each year for Americans ... (1/2)
The prescription drug delivery system – how a drug gets from the manufacturer to the patient – is complicated.
We also need to make sure that any action we may take does not jeopardize innovation so patients can continue to see breakthroughs
We have all heard from patients in our states that the costs of new prescription drugs are often too much for them to afford.
"My goal for these hearings is to, in a bipartisan way, learn what goes into the price patients pay when picking up their prescriptions."
These hearings came at the request of a bipartisan group of senators led by Sen. Cassidy and Sen. Franken 
"Today we are holding a hearing, the second in a series on prescription drug costs"

I want to hear today about the public-private partnership that NIH is leading (1/2)
The most ambitious goal of #21stCenturyCures was to drive research discoveries predicted by @NIHDirector including non-addictive painkillers
I hope today’s panel of witnesses can give this committee an update on the federal response to the crisis – what’s working &amp; what needs work
"This is a crisis. Not just in Tennessee, but across the country."
"Last yr., 1,631 Tennesseans died of drug overdose--12% more than the yr. before--mostly due to an increase in overdoses of synthetic opioids"
The amount of opioids prescribed in the U.S. in 2015 was enough for every American to be medicated around the clock for three weeks
"The opioid crisis is tearing our communities &amp; families apart, &amp; posing an enormous challenge to health care providers and law enforcement"

There is a danger that if we do not act – Americans in some counties literally will have no insurance to buy
Objective of hearings -- what Congress &amp; President can do between now &amp; the end of the month to help limit premium increases in 2018

The FDA is the agency responsible for making sure the promise of the 21st Century Cures Act actually reaches America’s patients
Now the next step ... is to fund the Food and Drug Administration.
"21st Century Cures became law last year and provided $4.8 billion for medical research, on top of the support Congress already provides"

We may soon have a situation where no insurance company is willing to sell insurance on an #Obamacare exchange
"If the #Obamacare policyholder isn’t paying the higher premiums in the exchange, then you, the taxpayer, will..."
The bill I am introducing will not fix #Obamacare. It is not a permanent solution. We still must repeal &amp; replace the law.
A growing number of states--including #TN--that have multiple insurers have only one insurer selling policies in a majority of counties
"People buying on #Obamacare exchanges will have only 1 insurer to choose from in the entire state in 5 states next year: AL, AK, OK, SC, WY"
"2: Waive #Obamacare requirement that you buy a specific health care plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four next year"
"1: States w failing #Obamacare exchange could allow residents to purchase any health plan, even those off the exchange, for 2017"
This legislation will do 2 things for the nearly 11 million Americans who buy health insurance on the #Obamacare exchanges
"You may be eligible for an #Obamacare subsidy..but there’s also a good chance the insurance you currently have may be gone by November,"
It takes a certain amount of creativity for Senate Dems to come to the floor and complain about #Zika funding--THEY refused the vote.

#TBT to 6 years ago when Alexander warned the president premiums would rise under #Obamacare 
Dems want to spend more taxpayer $ to prop up the exchanges and they want to expand the role of gov't in your private health care decisions
"But if there is a Democrat in the White House, broad systemic, structural changes to #Obamacare will still be necessary"
"If there’s a Republican in the White House next year, we need to repeal #Obamacare and replace it with step-by-step reforms"
"Politico reports that one Arizona county [Pinal] is “poised to become an Obamacare ghost town"" #Obamacare"
"A similar picture in North Carolina, West Virginia, Utah, South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, and Florida. #Obamacare"
"For the 2017 plan year, it is estimated that 60% of Tennessee’s counties will have only one insurer offering #Obamacare plans."
"According to Avalere Health, Americans buying insurance in 1/3 of #Obamacare exchange regions next yr may have only 1 insurer to choose from"
"Next year, Tennesseans will pay an intolerable increase—on average b/w 44 &amp; 62% more for their #Obamacare plans than they paid last year."
"This Nov., when Tennesseans sign up for 2017 #Obamacare plans, there will be fewer plans to choose from &amp; they’ll be much more expensive."
This might be what Repubs predicted—but it’s happening even faster than we imagined—and no one is happy about being right. #obamacare
"Today, an alarming number of health insurance companies are leaving #Obamacare exchanges"
