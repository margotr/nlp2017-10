.@SASCmajority also added over $700 million for cyber-related requirements like first-ever Cyber Posture Review
I‚Äôm proud of the strong provisions the Strategic Forces subcommittee contributed to the bill before us today.
Jurisdiction of the #StrategicForces also includes outer space. We added over $700 million to address unfunded needs for space operations
"In #StrategicForces SubCom, which I chair, we authorized an additional $200 million to improve the GMD system. #MissileDefense"
#NDAA authorizes the resources our men &amp; women in uniform need to respond to these crises and do the job the nation asks of them.
"But, the #NDAA is more than just answering these threats. It‚Äôs about helping us here at home, too."
The global turmoil of today highlights why the #NDAA bill before us is so important.
"We remain a nation at war, with thousands of men and women in uniform still deployed to the Middle East and Afghanistan."
#NorthKorea is relentlessly pursuing long-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to our shores.

At 1:50PM #AirForce1 landed at @Offutt_AFB with President George W Bush. For 2 hours @US_Stratcom was the center of U.S. nat‚Äôl defense
"As the day unfolded, @US_Stratcom received notice that the ‚Äúsecure location‚Äù the president would be using was @Offutt_AFB"
.@US_Stratcom worked to identify which planes had been hijacked &amp; monitored the landings of thousands of civilian aircraft.
"When the 2nd plane hit on 9/11, @US_Stratcom understood this was not a fictional threat: America was under attack"
The main purpose of the exercise was to test the military's command and control procedures in the event of nuclear warfare.

The #administration is conducting the first review of ballistic missile threats &amp; our missile defense posture since 2010 #MissileDefense

As chairman of @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte I work w #MissileDefenseAgency directors &amp; STRATCOM commanders to impve our #MissileDefense
We cannot rely on deterrence alone. We must ensure that our missile defense efforts stay ahead of #NorthKorea's accelerating developments.
The Chinese view #NorthKorea through a narrow lens of immediate strategic interest. That is how we must target our actions.
One thing is certain: the principle economic enablers of #NorthKorea are China and Russia.

"Specialist Bailey earned several military awards including the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Iraqi Campaign Medal &amp; Combat Action Badge. #Honor"
More than one thousand people gathered in Bellevue to remember Bill. #NEHeroes
"On May 25, 2007, during a security escort mission, Bill‚Äôs vehicle struck an improvised explosive device. Bill Bailey was killed. #NEHeroes"
"By 2007, the insurgency in Iraq had erupted to new levels of violence. Increased American forces sought to destroy the al Qaeda network."
"In 2006, his unit was deployed and assigned to provide security escorts for truck convoys operating out of Balad Air Base in #Iraq."
"That deep desire to serve the country continued to tug at him. In 2005, Bill re-enlisted in the @NENationalGuard #Courage"
Bill‚Äôs protective nature made him a great father. It also made him a great firefighter. #NeHeroes
"After 9/11, Bill felt the call to serve his country again. But, first things first. Bill and Dee married in 2004."
"In December 2000, Bill met Dee. She was a bank teller at Wells Fargo; he drove an armored truck. They met through a service window."
Bill attended Bellevue East where the call to protect his country prompted him to enlist in the @NENationalGuard in 1995.

Let‚Äôs take advantage of this moment when we have common ground on a commonsense and straightforward legislation for #EqualPay #Bipartisan
Most importantly this bill is possible: 53 Republican and 5 Dem Senators supported a version of the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct last Congress.
Many congressional Democrats requested and even praised an Obama executive order with similar language to my proposal #EqualPay
"Importantly for employers, the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct wouldn't impose new federal regulations or mandates"
"With this flexibility, women can better negotiate arrangements that make sense for them. #Flexibility"
"When employees, especially women, have more information, they can confidently pursue favorable work and wage arrangements #KnowledgeIsPower"
A culture of silence and fear of retaliation can keep people in the dark about how their wages compare to others‚Äô #KnowledgeIsPower

The #DIGITAct will bring together a working group of federal agencies &amp; private sector stakeholders to develop #IoT
Cooperation between the private and public sectors is essential to develop the #IoT.
Can Congress stay out of the way of #IoT progress? I think ‚Äòyes.‚Äô Our #DIGITAct passed @SenateCommerce in January
