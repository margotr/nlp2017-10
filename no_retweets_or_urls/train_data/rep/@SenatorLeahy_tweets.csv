BREAKING: REAX Of Senator Patrick Leahy To The Senate’s Vote To Proceed To Consideration Of Trumpcare Legislation…

"We can improve healthcare, but not like this. I’ve worked w @SenatorShaheen &amp; others to immediately stabilize insurance markets."
"Trumpcare is a tax bill, disguised as a health plan, to slash billions from the Medicaid help that is vital to millions of Americans."
