20. I‚Äôm also not going to stop looking for a solution ‚Äì giving up isn‚Äôt what we were sent here to do.

17. But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm not doing ‚Äì I‚Äôm not going to impugn the intentions of people who disagree
16. You can‚Äôt just put your head in the sand and ignore those facts and hope that it lives forever
"15. Its price tag grew and grew from the billions into the trillions, and finally scoring agencies just gave up"
"14. The ACA is not sustainable, and hasn‚Äôt been from the beginning. Its foundation was built on certain groups that never signed up"
13. I remain committed to repealing the ACA and replacing it with a system that works for all families
"12. So that‚Äôs where we stand today. A bad program that has grown deep roots, and a bitterly divided political culture."
"11. We‚Äôve got to realize that our pattern should not be disagree and destroy, but rather disagree and solve"
"10. And two ‚Äì along the way we stopped fighting the policy, and started fighting the people behind it"
9. No matter how badly the program serves (or doesn‚Äôt serve) the people ‚Äì replacing an entitlement is hard
"8. The ACA went into effect, and ‚Äì ‚ÄúA government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we‚Äôll ever see on this earth‚Äù (Reagan)"
7. Two things happened along the way to where we stand today
6. These are facts ‚Äì you can‚Äôt argue with them. And that‚Äôs not how our health care system should work
"5. Not everyone got to keep their doctors, and they weren‚Äôt able to keep their plans"
"4. Millions are paying for insurance they don‚Äôt want. In SC, more than 100,000 stuck without an option"
"3. In South Carolina, we‚Äôre down to one insurer offering plans on the exchanges.We‚Äôre seeing triple digit premium hikes,sky high deductibles"
"2. The debt continues to grow, and the ACA is not getting any better. The former isn‚Äôt helped by the latter."
