"So, when I go back to Washington next week to discuss healthcare, I’ll carry the concerns and challenges of Jackman/rural Maine with me."
This impacts everything – a CBP officer told me today they struggle to recruit/keep border patrol personnel due to limited healthcare.
"That means that the a mill worker on the late shift, or an elderly citizen who slips and falls, would have to drive over an hour for care."
"At the moment, Jackman stands to lose overnight emergency medical services at the end of the year."
